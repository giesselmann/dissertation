\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

It is astonishing how, based on the same genetic information coded into the DNA, cells in an organism can differentiate into a variety of specialized types with a multitude of different tasks.
Beginning with a single cell, a temporal, spatial and functional coordination determines the growth and body formation of eukaryotic organisms.
Depending on the cell state, only a fraction of genes is actively transcribed, while others remain repressed.
Acting as an additional regulatory layer, the epigenome describes a set of chemical modifications made to the DNA, controlling, inter alia, the activation and transcription of genes into RNA and ultimately proteins.
Present sequencing technologies and connected bioinformatics provide researchers with the tools to study sequence and epigenetic state down to single cell and single molecule resolution.
Starting 1990 and taking over a decade until completion, the human genome project incorporated an international team of researchers with the aim of deciphering for the first time the genetic blueprint to build a human being. 
Based on elementary sequencing technology, the outcome was already a nearly complete reference sequence including gene annotations.
Since then, the development of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enabled studies of countless organisms, cell types and disease conditions. 
While being very reliable in terms of throughput and accuracy, sequenced fragments of at most few hundreds nucleotides in length still limit the readout from repetitive regions or resolution of long distance dependencies on a single molecule.




\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro:motivation}

Most recently, a third-generation of sequencing techniques is introducing new perspectives to the field of genome analysis by generating previously unattainable read lengths with averages in the tens of thousands of nucleotides. 
Still under active development and with frequent improvements, long-read sequencing provides new opportunities by, visually speaking, increasing the size of the puzzle pieces.
Moreover, direct sequencing of DNA and RNA molecules using the nanopore technology facilitates the detection of different types of base modifications.
Modern nanopore sequencing devices, producing large data sets within few days, open therefore a new field of research at the intersection of genomics, computer science and engineering. 
New data types, formats and error characteristics demand here the adaptation of existing and development of new algorithms for bioinformatic software.




\section{Genome Regulation}
\label{sec:intro:bio}

Most cell types of an eukaryotic organism contain a copy of the genetic code in form of folded DNA in the nucleus.
Virtually all mammals have diploid cells with homologous maternal and paternal copies, organized into chromosome pairs with the same genes at the same locations.
While the entire human genome comprises about three billion nucleotides in total, the longest continuous stretch of DNA is the first of 23 chromosome pairs with 247 million base pairs. 
To maintain its integrity and supporting the chromatin structure formation, the DNA is wrapped around octamers of histone proteins called nucleosomes (Fig. \ref{fig:intro:chromatin}).

	\caption[Chromosome to nucleotide structure]{The DNA of each chromosome is wrapped around histones, forming nucleosomes and the chromatin structure. Chemical modifications to histone tails and individual base pairs impact properties and cellular function (Adapted from \cite{zymo2020}).}
	\label{fig:intro:chromatin}
\end{figure}

The \textasciitilde 147bp of DNA directly twisted around each nucleosome is protected against physical access from for instance transcription factors (TFs). 
The dynamic positioning of nucleosomes is therefore part of the epigenetic regulation process during transcription and replication.
Accordingly, nucleosomes are enriched at compacted heterochromatin in mostly inactive genomic regions, while being depleted at regulatory elements such as enhancers, insulators and transcribed genes \cite{Klemm2019}. 
A growing number of chemical modifications to histone tails (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) is reported to impact inter-nucleosomal interactions, but also leading to recruitment of proteins and complexes involved in transcription, replication and DNA repair \cite{Bannister2011}. 
A well characterized example is the methylation of lysine 79 on the H3 tail (H3K79me3) found at the transcription start sites (TSS) of active genes \cite{Lawrence2016}. 
To be further mentioned in this context are H3K4me3 marking active euchromatin, while H3K9me3 is indicating repressive heterochromatin.
Gene expression may be influenced by nearby active enhancer sites with enrichment of H3K27ac (acetylation).
Finally, repressed and bivalent promoters are modified with H3K27me3 and the combination of H3K4me4 and H3K27me3 respectively.

For embryonic development in mammals, the methylation of cytosine in the CpG-context (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is a vital epigenetic modification. Prominent examples of its importance are the X-chromosome inactivation in females and genomic imprinting.
Furthermore, the DNA methylation is associated with the silencing of transposable elements, shows high levels over actively transcribed gene bodies and correlates with gene repression \cite{Greenberg2019}.
Throughout cellular reprogramming, \textit{de-novo} methylation of the DNA is primarily established by the DNMT3A and DNMT3B enzymes. 
During cell division, the methylation state on the nascent strand in the symmetric CpG-context is restored by the DNMT1 enzyme.
In absence of the maintenance methyltransferase, the 5mC modification is therefore passively lost during each round of replication, but can also be actively removed by oxidation through the TET methylcytosine dioxygenases.
There is a downside of cythosine methylation in the form of potential spontaneous deamination of 5mC, resulting in inherited C to T transitions and ultimately a depletion of CpG sites in mammalian genomes \cite{Holliday1993}. 
The human genome for example, contains only around 29M CpGs instead of 188M as anticipated from the genome size. 
Thus, the conservation under evolutionary pressure underlines the importance of DNA methylation for mammals, while its diverse functions are still not yet fully understood.


On genome wide scale, methylation levels undergo two waves of reprogramming during embryonic development, of which the first one till stem cell state is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:intro:methylation}.

After blastocyst stage at mouse embryonic day E3.5, DNMT3A and DNMT3B establish \textit{de-novo} methylation under co-expression of DNMT3L. Extra embryonic tissues show a relative hypomethylation compared to the epiblast stem cells (Adapted from \cite{Greenberg2019}).}
	\label{fig:intro:methylation}
\end{figure}

Characteristic for human somatic cells is a genome wide mean methylation of approximately 70\%-80\% \cite{Bird2002}. Averaging the binary 5mC state of individual cells yields mean methylation levels per genomic position. What is striking is the underlying bimodal distribution, with CpG dense regions, also referred to as CpG islands (CGIs), being mostly unmethylated, while the genomic background of more isolated CpGs is mostly methylated \cite{Bird2002}.
A large number of the CGIs in mammals act as promoters, nonetheless the majority remains unmethylated during differentiation and gene silencing is driven by H3K27 methylation \cite{Larsen1992, Greenberg2019}.

\section{Sequencing Technologies}
\label{sec:intro:sequencing}

\textit{"For their contributions concerning the determination of base sequences in nucleic acids"}, Walter Gilbert and Frederick Sanger received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Referred to as first generation or \textbf{Sanger sequencing}, their 'dideoxy method' allowed for the first time to determine the nucleotide sequence of an entire organism with high accuracy \cite{Sanger1977}.
While superseded by second and third generation technologies on genome wide level, Sanger sequencing can still be the method of choice, for instance to verify plasmid sequences, check genotypes or confirm genome editing.

Starting of in 2005 with the 454 Genome Sequencer, the development and commercialization of sequencing by synthesis approaches lead to increasing throughput and broad availability of the second, also termed \textbf{next generation sequencing} (NGS) technologies.
Different platforms, all with typical read lengths of at most few hundred nucleotides include 454, Illumina, SOLiD and Ion torrent.
As marked leader, and with the HiSeq X Ten platform the first company to break the milestone of US\$1000 for a human genome in 2014, Illumina sequencing serves as gold standard and second generation reference in this work \cite{Dijk2014}.

In contrast to the high-throughput short-read sequencing, \textbf{third generation} long-read technologies do not necessarily require amplification and yield read lengths in the range of tens of thousands nucleotides. 
Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing introduced by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) in 2011 is considered to be the first commercially available long-read technology \cite{Dijk2018}.
While the idea of nanopore sequencing goes back to the 1980s, it took until 2014 to release the pocket sized MinION as first device by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) \cite{Deamer2016}.

\end{figure}


Among other devices distributed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), the MinION in particular is gaining prominence. In brief, the nanopore sequencing process is based on guiding a nucleotide polymer through a pore inserted in a membrane while measuring a change in ionic current as a proxy signal over time. This signal is then interpreted to determine the underlying DNA or RNA sequence. The nanopore technology enables direct readout of sequences from individual DNA or RNA molecules, including base modifications, since no synthesis or amplification is required.
