\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{cha:state_of_art}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Zoom out history \cite{Deamer2016}
\end{itemize}

\section{Nanopore Sequencing in the Literature}
\label{sec:state_of_art:nanopore_literature}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivation: Too many publications to read, too fast progress to stay up to date
    \item Motivation: OpenSyllabusGallxy visualizing books read in NA universities.
    \item Introduce S2ORC dataset, summary, paper, journals, topics
    \item Complement with Crossref API
    \item Plot UMAP of all publications, highlight 'nanopore cluster'
    %\item paper over time, impact (over time?) topics
    \item wordclouds or timeline to illustrate usage of the technology
    \item most impact by incoming citations, normalized by year/age
    \item missing but relevant publications for this work, limitations of computational literature scan
\end{itemize}

\section{\Biorxiv\ Preprints}
\label{sec:state_of_art:biorxiv}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Role of preprints for nanopore, bioRxiv as platform
    \item stats of bioRxiv, paper, topics, nanopore paper, publication rate and impact
    \item Example of read-until, visible for in-field experts, hidden for outsider?
    \item Comment/Opinion on preprints in fast-moving fields, coronavirus example, weight potential against risks
    \item Mention Twitter as fast but also least reliable source
\end{itemize}

\section{Throughput and Accuracy}
\label{sec:stat_of_art:throughput}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Representative Flow-Cells over time (from 3 to 30 GBp in 48h)
    \item Size selection, shearing, nuclease flush
    \item throughput over time plot
    \item accuracy last albacore, guppy-fast, guppy-hac (mention flappie, scrappie, SACall, chiron, ...)
    \item cite benchmark paper, illustrate need for in-house benchmark of each new version
    \item Mapping of long reads depending on genomic context, read length, Q-Score etc.
    \item Accuracy of base modifications: Nanopolish, Signalign, DeepMod, DeepSignal etc.
    %\item Nanopolish context and signal level analysis
\end{itemize}
