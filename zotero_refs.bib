  abstract     = {Motivation: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as {BLAT} and {SSAHA}2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time., Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment ({BWA}-{SW}), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as {SSAHA}2, more accurate than {BLAT}, and is several to tens of times faster than both., Availability: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net, Contact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Nanopore-based sequencing techniques can reconstruct properties of biosequences by analyzing the sequence-dependent ionic current steps produced as biomolecules pass through a pore. Typically this involves alignment of new data to a reference, where both reference construction and alignment have been performed by hand., Results: We propose an automated method for aligning nanopore data to a reference through the use of hidden Markov models. Several features that arise from prior processing steps and from the class of enzyme used can be simply incorporated into the model. Previously, the M2MspA nanopore was shown to be sensitive enough to distinguish between cytosine, methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine. We validated our automated methodology on a subset of that data by automatically calculating an error rate for the distinction between the three cytosine variants and show that the automated methodology produces a 2–3\% error rate, lower than the 10\% error rate from previous manual segmentation and alignment., Availability and implementation: The data, output, scripts and tutorials replicating the analysis are available at https://github.com/{UCSCNanopore}/Data/tree/master/Automation., Contact:

The genome-wide localization and function of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in adult stem cells are unknown. Here, we show that in human epidermal stem cells, the two proteins bind in a histone H3K36me3-dependent manner to the most active enhancers and are required to produce their associated enhancer {RNAs}. Both proteins prefer super-enhancers associated to genes that either define the ectodermal lineage or establish the stem cell and differentiated states. However, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b differ in their mechanisms of enhancer regulation: Dnmt3a associates with p63 to maintain high levels of {DNA} hydroxymethylation at the center of enhancers in a Tet2-dependent manner, whereas Dnmt3b promotes {DNA} methylation along the body of the enhancer. Depletion of either protein inactivates their target enhancers and profoundly affects epidermal stem cell function. Altogether, we reveal novel functions for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b at enhancers that could contribute to their roles in disease and tumorigenesis.},

To that end, we performed comprehensive transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of populations derived through directed differentiation of {hESCs} representing each of the three embryonic germ layers. Integration of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and {RNA} sequencing reveals unique events associated with specification toward each lineage. Lineage-specific dynamic alterations in {DNA} methylation and H3K4me1 are evident at putative distal regulatory elements that are frequently bound by pluripotency factors in the undifferentiated {hESCs}. In addition, we identified germ-layer-specific H3K27me3 enrichment at sites exhibiting high {DNA} methylation in the undifferentiated state. A better understanding of these initial specification events will facilitate identification of deficiencies in current approaches, leading to more faithful differentiation strategies as well as providing insights into the rewiring of human regulatory programs during cellular transitions.},

However, the underlying mechanisms that direct this genome-scale transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its systematic acquisition or potential developmental utility. Here, we analysed global remethylation from the mouse preimplantation embryo into the early epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, {CpG} density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor. The extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of embryonically protected {CpG} island promoters, particularly those that are associated with key developmental regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human cancer types. Our data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of {DNA} methylation-based suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this decision is made deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used-and frequently oncogenic-signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the spontaneous reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic landscape.},

Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, {CLLs} consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of {DNA} methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single {CLL} cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression.

Here, we report the excessive frequency and apparent selectivity of retrotransposition of {ES} cell-specific genes. Six highly homologous pseudogenes for Oct4, 10 for Nanog, and 16 for Stella were identified by nucleotide {BLAST} (basic local alignment sequence tool) searches against the respective gene {mRNA} transcripts. Of 15 non-{ES} cell-specific transcription factor genes, only one had a single pseudogene hit in our screen, emphasizing the apparent selectivity. We present a hypothesis whereby retrotransposition of {ES} or germ cell-specific genes may reflect an innate predisposition. This is based on the increased probability of germ-line transmission when retrotransposition occurs at a very early stage of development within cells known to contribute to the germ cell lineage. The parental genes for Nanog, Stella, and another embryonic gene, {GDF}3 are all located on chromosome 12p13 of the human genome, and on chromosome 6 in mouse. Here, we identified an Oct4 pseudogene at the same respective loci in both human and mouse genomes, suggesting functional relevance and indicative of epigenetic regulation. We tested whether the apparent susceptibility for {ES} cell-specific gene retrotransposition may be extrapolated to a more unified phenomenon, such that a bioinformatic approach may represent a potentially novel strategy for identification of genes with embryonic cell-specific functionality. A preliminary investigation indeed revealed a single gene, previously demonstrated to be responsible for multiple retropseudogenes via germ cell-specific expression in Xenopus.},

  abstract     = {The transcription factor Oct4 is well defined as a key regulator of embryonic stem ({ES}) cell pluripotency. In recent years, the role of Oct4 has purportedly extended to the self renewal and maintenance of multipotency in adult stem cell ({ASC}) populations. This profile has arisen mainly from reports utilising reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) based methodologies and has since come under scrutiny following the discovery that many developmental genes have multiple pseudogenes associated with them. Six known pseudogenes exist for Oct4, all of which exhibit very high sequence homology (three {\textgreater}97\%), and for this reason the generation of artefacts may have contributed to false identification of Oct4 in somatic cell populations. While {ASC} lack a molecular blueprint of transcription factors proposed to be involved with 'stemness' as described for {ES} cells, it is not unreasonable to assume that similar gene patterns may exist. The focus of this work was to corroborate reports that Oct4 is involved in the regulation of {ASC} self-renewal and differentiation, using a combination of methodologies to rule out pseudogene interference. Haematopoietic stem cells ({HSC}) derived from human umbilical cord blood ({UCB}) and various differentiated cell lines underwent {RT}-{PCR}, product sequencing and transfection studies using an Oct4 promoter-driven reporter. In summary, only the positive control expressed Oct4, with all other cell types expressing a variety of Oct4 pseudogenes. Somatic cells were incapable of utilising an exogenous Oct4 promoter construct, leading to the conclusion that Oct4 does not appear involved in the multipotency of human {HSC} from {UCB}.},

  abstract     = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Heterochromatin is integral to cell identity maintenance by impeding the activation of genes for alternate cell fates. Heterochromatic regions are associated with histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) or H3K27me3, but these modifications are also found in euchromatic regions that permit transcription. We discovered that resistance to sonication is a reliable indicator of the heterochromatin state, and we developed a biophysical method (gradient-seq) to discriminate subtypes of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains in sonication-resistant heterochromatin ({srHC}) versus euchromatin. These classifications are more accurate than the histone marks alone in predicting transcriptional silence and resistance of alternate fate genes to activation during direct cell conversion. Our proteomics of H3K9me3-marked {srHC} and functional screens revealed diverse proteins, including {RBMX} and {RBMXL}1, that impede gene induction during cellular reprogramming. Isolation of {srHC} with gradient-seq provides a genome-wide map of chromatin structure, elucidating subtypes of repressed domains that are uniquely predictive of diverse other chromatin properties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

With a growing number of partially or completely sequenced genomes, multiple alignment is playing an increasingly important role in these studies. In recent years, various tools for pair-wise and multiple genomic alignment have been proposed. Some of them are extremely fast, but often efficiency is achieved at the expense of sensitivity. One way of combining speed and sensitivity is to use an anchored-alignment approach. In a first step, a fast search program identifies a chain of strong local sequence similarities. In a second step, regions between these anchor points are aligned using a slower but more accurate method.},

It is unclear whether long-read sequencing technologies can traverse these long, challenging repeat expansions. Here, we demonstrate that two long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences' ({PacBio}) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies', can sequence through disease-causing repeats cloned into plasmids, including the {FTD}/{ALS}-causing G4C2 repeat expansion. We also report the first long-read sequencing data characterizing the C9orf72 G4C2 repeat expansion at the nucleotide level in a symptomatic expansion carrier. Our findings indicate that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterizing known disease-causing repeat expansions, and for discovering new disease-causing or disease-modifying repeat expansions that have gone undetected with conventional short-read sequencing. Larger and deeper long-read sequencing studies in C9orf72 expansion carriers will be important to determine heterogeneity and whether the repeats are interrupted by non-G4C2 content, potentially mitigating or modifying the disease course or age of onset, as interruptions are known to do in other repeat-expansion disorders. These results have broad implications across all diseases where the genetic etiology remains unclear.},

However, the mechanisms by which {TEs} contribute to gene expression are largely uncharacterized. Here, we leverage Roadmap and {GTEx} data to investigate the dynamics of {TE} recruitment in 24 tissues. We find 112 human {TE} types enriched in active regions of the genome across tissues. {SINEs} and {DNA} transposons are the most frequently enriched classes, while {LTRs} are often co-opted in a tissue specific manner. We report across-tissue variability in {TE} enrichment in active regions. Genes with consistent expression across tissues are less likely to be associated to {TE} insertions. {TE} repression similarly follows tissue specific patterns, and {LTRs} are the most abundant class in repressed regions. Different {TE} classes are preferentially silenced in different ways: {LTRs} and {LINEs} are overrepresented in regions marked by H3K9me3, while other {TEs} are preferentially repressed by H3K27me3. Young {TEs} are typically enriched in repressed regions and depleted in active regions. We detect multiple instances of {TEs} with tissue specific regulatory activity. Such {TEs} provide binding sites for transcription factors that are master regulators for the given tissue. These tissue specific activated {TEs} are enriched in intronic enhancers, and significantly affect the expression of the associated genes. Finally we show that {SVAs} can act as transcriptional activators or repressors in a tissue specific context. We provide an integrated overview of the contribution of {TEs} to human gene regulation. Expanding previous analyses, we demonstrate that {TEs} generate regulatory novelty in a tissue specific fashion.},

This mobility has the potential to affect gene transcription and cause disease. However, {TEs} are technically challenging to identify, which complicates efforts to assess the impact of {TE} insertions on disease. Here we present a targeted sequencing protocol and computational pipeline to identify polymorphic and novel {TE} insertions using next-generation sequencing: {TE}-{NGS}. The method simultaneously targets the three subfamilies that are responsible for the majority of recent {TE} activity (L1HS, {AluYa}5/8, and {AluYb}8/9) thereby obviating the need for multiple experiments and reducing the amount of input material required.
{RESULTS}: Here we describe the laboratory protocol and detection algorithm, and a benchmark experiment for the reference genome {NA}12878. We demonstrate a substantial enrichment for on-target fragments, and high sensitivity and precision to both reference and {NA}12878-specific insertions. We report 17 previously unreported loci for this individual which are supported by orthogonal long-read evidence, and we identify 1470 polymorphic and novel {TEs} in 12 additional samples that were previously undocumented in databases of insertion polymorphisms.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We anticipate that future applications of {TE}-{NGS} alongside exome sequencing of patients with sporadic disease will reduce the number of unresolved cases, and improve estimates of the contribution of {TEs} to human genetic disease.},

  abstract     = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat ({GGGGCC}) in the noncoding region of the C9ORF72 gene are the most common cause of the familial form of {ALS} (C9-{ALS}), as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and other neurological diseases. How the repeat expansion causes disease remains unclear, with both loss of function (haploinsufficiency) and gain of function (either toxic {RNA} or protein products) proposed. We report a cellular model of C9-{ALS} with motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}) derived from {ALS} patients carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. No significant loss of C9ORF72 expression was observed, and knockdown of the transcript was not toxic to cultured human motor neurons. Transcription of the repeat was increased, leading to accumulation of {GGGGCC} repeat–containing {RNA} foci selectively in C9-{ALS} {iPSC}-derived motor neurons. Repeat-containing {RNA} foci colocalized with {hnRNPA}1 and Pur-α, suggesting that they may be able to alter {RNA} metabolism. C9-{ALS} motor neurons showed altered expression of genes involved in membrane excitability including {DPP}6, and demonstrated a diminished capacity to fire continuous spikes upon depolarization compared to control motor neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the C9ORF72 transcript suppressed {RNA} foci formation and reversed gene expression alterations in C9-{ALS} motor neurons.

  abstract     = {Long-reads, point-of-care, and {PCR}-free are the promises brought by nanopore sequencing. Among various steps in nanopore data analysis, the global mapping between the raw electrical current signal sequence and the expected signal sequence from the pore model serves as the key building block to base calling, reads mapping, variant identification, and methylation detection. However, the ultra-long reads of nanopore sequencing and an order of magnitude difference in the sampling speeds of the two sequences make the classical dynamic time warping ({DTW}) and its variants infeasible to solve the problem. Here, we propose a novel multi-level {DTW} algorithm, {cwDTW}, based on continuous wavelet transforms with different scales of the two signal sequences. Our algorithm starts from low-resolution wavelet transforms of the two sequences, such that the transformed sequences are short and have similar sampling rates. Then the peaks and nadirs of the transformed sequences are extracted to form feature sequences with similar lengths, which can be easily mapped by the original {DTW}. Our algorithm then recursively projects the warping path from a lower-resolution level to a higher-resolution one by building a context-dependent boundary and enabling a constrained search for the warping path in the latter. Comprehensive experiments on two real nanopore datasets on human and on Pandoraea pnomenusa, as well as two benchmark datasets from previous studies, demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In particular, {cwDTW} can almost always generate warping paths that are very close to the original {DTW}, which are remarkably more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods including {FastDTW} and {PrunedDTW}. Meanwhile, on the real nanopore datasets, {cwDTW} is about 440 times faster than {FastDTW} and 3000 times faster than the original {DTW}. Our program is available at https://github.com/realbigws/{cwDTW}.},

  abstract     = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet} classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract     = {{LINE}-1 (L1) retrotransposons represent approximately one sixth of the human genome, but only the human-specific L1HS-Ta subfamily acts as an endogenous mutagen in modern humans, reshaping both somatic and germline genomes. Due to their high levels of sequence identity and the existence of many polymorphic insertions absent from the reference genome, the transcriptional activation of individual genomic L1HS-Ta copies remains poorly understood. Here we comprehensively mapped fixed and polymorphic L1HS-Ta copies in 12 commonly-used somatic cell lines, and identified transcriptional and epigenetic signatures allowing the unambiguous identification of active L1HS-Ta copies in their genomic context. Strikingly, only a very restricted subset of L1HS-Ta loci - some being polymorphic among individuals - significantly contributes to the bulk of L1 expression, and these loci are differentially regulated among distinct cell lines. Thus, our data support a local model of L1 transcriptional activation in somatic cells, governed by individual-, locus-, and cell-type-specific determinants., {DOI}:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/{eLife}.13926.001, Retrotransposons, also known as jumping genes, have invaded the genomes of most living organisms. These fragments of {DNA} have the ability to move or copy themselves from one location of a chromosome to another. Depending on where they insert themselves, retrotransposons can modify the sequence of nearby genes, which can alter or even abolish their activity. Although these genetic modifications have contributed significantly to the evolution of different species, retrotransposons can also have detrimental effects; for example, by causing new cases of genetic diseases., Adult human cells have a number of mechanisms that work to keep the activity of retrotransposons at a very low level. However, in many types of cancers retrotransposons escape these defense mechanisms and ‘jump’ actively. This is thought to contribute to the development and spread of cancerous tumors., To understand how jumping genes are mobilized, a fundamental question must be answered: is the high jumping gene activity observed in some cell types a result of activating many copies of the retrotransposons, or only a few of them? This question has been difficult to address because there are more than one hundred copies of retrotransposons that could potentially move in humans, many of which have not even been referenced in the human genome map. Furthermore, each copy is almost identical to another one, making it difficult to discriminate between them., Philippe et al. have now developed an approach that can map where individual retrotransposons are located in the genome of normal and cancerous cells and measure how active these jumping genes are. This revealed that only a very restricted number of them are active in any given cell type. Moreover, different subsets of jumping genes are active in different cell types, and their locations in the genome often do not overlap., Thus, whether jumping genes are activated depends on the cell type and their position in the genome. These results are in contrast to the prevalent view that retrotransposons are activated in a more widespread manner across the genome, at least in cancerous cells. Overall, Philippe et al.’s findings pave the way towards characterizing the chromosome regions in which retrotransposons are frequently activated and understanding how they contribute to cancer and other diseases., {DOI}:

  abstract     = {{DNA} cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation, development and disease. Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger {RNA} and small {RNA} components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of {DNA}–protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-{CG} context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-{CG} contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-{CG} methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.},

  abstract     = {{DNA} methylation plays an important role in development and disease. The primary sites of {DNA} methylation in vertebrates are cytosines in the {CpG} dinucleotide context, which account for roughly three quarters of the total {DNA} methylation content in human and mouse cells. While the genomic distribution, inter-individual stability, and functional role of {CpG} methylation are reasonably well understood, little is known about {DNA} methylation targeting {CpA}, {CpT}, and {CpC} (non-{CpG}) dinucleotides. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of non-{CpG} methylation in 76 genome-scale {DNA} methylation maps across pluripotent and differentiated human cell types. We confirm non-{CpG} methylation to be predominantly present in pluripotent cell types and observe a decrease upon differentiation and near complete absence in various somatic cell types. Although no function has been assigned to it in pluripotency, our data highlight that non-{CpG} methylation patterns reappear upon {iPS} cell reprogramming. Intriguingly, the patterns are highly variable and show little conservation between different pluripotent cell lines. We find a strong correlation of non-{CpG} methylation and {DNMT}3 expression levels while showing statistical independence of non-{CpG} methylation from pluripotency associated gene expression. In line with these findings, we show that knockdown of {DNMTA} and {DNMT}3B in {hESCs} results in a global reduction of non-{CpG} methylation. Finally, non-{CpG} methylation appears to be spatially correlated with {CpG} methylation. In summary these results contribute further to our understanding of cytosine methylation patterns in human cells using a large representative sample set.},

This combination of epigenetic marks at promoter or enhancer regions keeps genes expressed at low levels but poised for rapid activation. Typically, {DNA} at bivalent promoters is only lowly methylated in normal cells, but frequently shows elevated methylation levels in cancer samples. Here, we developed a universal classifier built from chromatin data that can identify cancer samples solely from hypermethylation of bivalent chromatin. Tested on over 7,000 {DNA} methylation data sets from several cancer types, it reaches an {AUC} of 0.92. Although higher levels of {DNA} methylation are often associated with transcriptional silencing, counter-intuitive positive statistical dependencies between {DNA} methylation and expression levels have been recently reported for two cancer types. Here, we re-analyze combined expression and {DNA} methylation data sets, comprising over 5,000 samples, and demonstrate that the conjunction of hypermethylation of bivalent chromatin and up-regulation of the corresponding genes is a general phenomenon in cancer. This up-regulation affects many developmental genes and transcription factors, including dozens of homeobox genes and other genes implicated in cancer. Thus, we reason that the disturbance of bivalent chromatin may be intimately linked to tumorigenesis.},

We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.},

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them “curriculum learning”. In the context of recent research studying the diﬃculty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that signiﬁcant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an eﬀect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).},

We show experimentally that all common {RNN} architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit. We further ﬁnd that for several tasks it is the per-task parameter capacity bound that determines performance. These results suggest that many previous results comparing {RNN} architectures are driven primarily by differences in training effectiveness, rather than differences in capacity. Supporting this observation, we compare training difﬁculty for several architectures, and show that vanilla {RNNs} are far more difﬁcult to train, yet have slightly higher capacity. Finally, we propose two novel {RNN} architectures, one of which is easier to train than the {LSTM} or {GRU} for deeply stacked architectures.},

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping \$F: Y {\textbackslash}rightarrow X\$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push \$F(G(X)) {\textbackslash}approx X\$ (and vice versa).

In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where {ADAM} does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of {ADAM} algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be ﬁxed by endowing such algorithms with “long-term memory” of past gradients, and propose new variants of the {ADAM} algorithm which not only ﬁx the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

We investigate a hybrid strategy that begins training with an adaptive method and switches to {SGD} when appropriate. Concretely, we propose {SWATS}, a simple strategy which switches from Adam to {SGD} when a triggering condition is satisfied. The condition we propose relates to the projection of Adam steps on the gradient subspace. By design, the monitoring process for this condition adds very little overhead and does not increase the number of hyperparameters in the optimizer. We report experiments on several standard benchmarks such as: {ResNet}, {SENet}, {DenseNet} and {PyramidNet} for the {CIFAR}-10 and {CIFAR}-100 data sets, {ResNet} on the tiny-{ImageNet} data set and language modeling with recurrent networks on the {PTB} and {WT}2 data sets.

  abstract     = {Tandem repeats ({TRs}) can cause disease through their length, sequence motif interruptions, and nucleotide modifications. For many {TRs}, however, these features are very difficult - if not impossible - to assess, requiring low-throughput and labor-intensive assays. One example is a {VNTR} in {ABCA}7 for which we recently discovered that expanded alleles strongly increase risk of Alzheimer′s disease. Here, we investigated the potential of long-read whole genome sequencing to surmount these challenges, using the high-throughput {PromethION} platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. To overcome the limitations of conventional base calling and alignment, we developed an algorithm to study the {TR} size and sequence directly on raw {PromethION} current data. We report the long-read sequencing of multiple human genomes (n = 11) using only a single sequencing run and flow cell per individual. With the use of fresh {DNA} extractions, {DNA} shearing to approximately 20kb and size selection, we obtained an average output of 70 gigabases (Gb) per flow cell, corresponding to a 21x genome coverage, and a maximum yield of 98 Gb (30x genome coverage). All {ABCA}7 {VNTR} alleles, including expansions up to 10,000 bases, were spanned by long sequencing reads, validated by Southern blotting. Classical approaches of {TR} length estimation suffered from low accuracy, low precision, {DNA} strand effects and/or inability to call pathogenic repeat expansions. In contrast, our novel {NanoSatellite} algorithm, which circumvents base calling by using dynamic time warping on raw {PromethION} current data, achieved more than 90\% accuracy and high precision (5.6\% relative standard deviation) of {TR} length estimation, and detected all clinically relevant repeat expansions. In addition, we identified alternative {TR} sequence motifs with high consistency, allowing determination of {TR} sequence and distinction of {VNTR} alleles with homozygous length. In conclusion, we validated the robustness of single-experiment whole genome long-read sequencing on {PromethION}, a prerequisite for application of long-read sequencing in the clinic. In addition, we outperformed Southern blotting, enabling improved characterization of the role of expanded {ABCA}7 {VNTR} alleles in Alzheimer′s disease, and opening new opportunities for {TR} research.},

We now report a sequencing method for the measurement of replication fork movement on single molecules by Detecting Nucleotide Analogue signal currents on extremely long nanopore traces (D-{NAscent}). Using this method, we detect {BrdU} incorporated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal, at a genomic scale and on single molecules, the {DNA} sequences replicated during a pulse labelling period. Under conditions of limiting {BrdU} concentration, D-{NAscent} detects the differences in {BrdU} incorporation frequency across individual molecules to reveal the location of active replication origins, fork direction, termination sites, and fork pausing/stalling events. We used sequencing reads of 20-160 kb, to generate the first whole genome single-molecule map of {DNA} replication dynamics and discover a new class of low frequency stochastic origins in budding yeast.},

It is particularly difficult for single molecule sequencing, which has a per-nucleotide error rate of {\textasciitilde}5\%-15\%. Meeting this demand, we developed Clairvoyante, a multi-task five-layer convolutional neural network model for predicting variant type ({SNP} or indel), zygosity, alternative allele and indel length from aligned reads. For the well-characterized {NA}12878 human sample, Clairvoyante achieved 99.73\%, 97.68\% and 95.36\% precision on known variants, and 98.65\%, 92.57\%, 87.26\% F1-score for whole-genome analysis, using Illumina, {PacBio}, and Oxford Nanopore data, respectively. Training on a second human sample shows Clairvoyante is sample agnostic and finds variants in less than two hours on a standard server. Furthermore, we identified 3,135 variants that are missed using Illumina but supported independently by both {PacBio} and Oxford Nanopore reads. Clairvoyante is available open-source (https://github.com/aquaskyline/Clairvoyante), with modules to train, utilize and visualize the model.},

  abstract     = {Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification. Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. Many methods for resolving these errors require access to reference genomes, high-fidelity short reads, or reference genomes, which are often not available. De novo error correction modules are available, often as part of assembly tools, but large-scale errors still remain in resulting assemblies, motivating further innovation in this area. We developed a novel Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) based method, called {MiniScrub}, for de novo identification and subsequent "scrubbing" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments. {MiniScrub} first generates read-to-read alignments by {MiniMap}, then encodes the alignments into images, and finally builds {CNN} models to predict low-quality segments that could be scrubbed based on a customized quality cutoff. Applying {MiniScrub} to real world control datasets under several different parameters, we show that it robustly improves read quality. Compared to raw reads, de novo genome assembly with scrubbed reads produces many fewer mis-assemblies and large indel errors. We propose {MiniScrub} as a tool for preprocessing Nanopore reads for downstream analyses. {MiniScrub} is open-source software and is available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-miniscrub},

  abstract     = {Pairwise alignment of nucleotide sequences has been calculated in practice by the seed-and-extend strategy, where we enumerate seeds (shared patterns) between sequences and then extend the seeds by a Smith-Waterman-like semi-global dynamic programming to obtain full pairwise alignments. With the advent of massively parallel short read sequencers, algorithms and data structures for efficiently finding seeds had been explored extensively. However, recent advances in single-molecule sequencing technologies enabled us to obtain millions of reads, each of which is orders of magnitude longer than those output by the short-read sequencers, demanding a faster algorithm for the extension step that dominates the computation time in pairwise local alignment. Our goal is to design a faster extension algorithm which overcomes the two major drawbacks of the single-molecule sequencers that the sequencing error rates is high (e.g., 10-15\%) and insertions and deletions are more frequent than substitutions are. We propose an adaptive banded dynamic programming ({DP}) algorithm for calculating pairwise semi-global alignment of nucleotide sequences that allows a relatively high insertion or deletion rate while maintaining the band width to some small constant (e.g., 32 cells). On every band advancing operation, cells at the forefront of the band are calculated simultaneously without mutual dependencies, allowing an efficient Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data ({SIMD}) parallelization. We show by an experiment that our algorithm runs approximately 8 times faster than the extension alignment algorithm in {NCBI} {BLAST}+ retaining the similar sensitivity and accuracy. The results indicate that the algorithm is capable of replacing extension alignment routines in the existing nucleotide local alignment programs.},

  abstract     = {Systematic variation in the methylation of cytosines at {CpG} sites plays a critical role in early development of humans and other mammals. Of particular interest are regions of differential methylation between parental alleles, as these often dictate monoallelic gene expression, resulting in parent of origin specific control of the embryonic transcriptome and subsequent development, in a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we show that, with an average genomic coverage of approximately ten, it is possible to determine both the level of methylation of {CpG} sites and the haplotype from which each read arises. The long-read property is exploited to characterise, using novel methods, both methylation and haplotype for reads that have reduced basecalling precision compared to Sanger sequencing. We validate the analysis both through comparison of nanopore-derived methylation patterns with those from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data and through comparison with previously reported data. Our analysis successfully identifies known imprinting control regions as well as some novel differentially methylated regions which, due to their proximity to hitherto unknown monoallelically expressed genes, may represent new imprinting control regions.},

  abstract     = {Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded {DNA} samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to {DNA} base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8\%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5\% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3\%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3\%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source ({GPLv}3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.},

The rapid development of long read sequencing provides the opportunity to sensitively discover {MEIs}. However, the signals of {MEIs} implied by noisy long reads are highly complex, due to the repetitiveness of mobile elements as well as the serious sequencing errors. Herein, we propose Realignment-based Mobile Element insertion detection Tool for Long read ({rMETL}). {rMETL} takes advantage of its novel chimeric read re-alignment approach to well handle complex {MEI} signals. Benchmarking results on simulated and real datasets demonstrated that {rMETL} has the ability to more sensitivity discover {MEIs} as well as prevent false positives. It is suited to produce high quality {MEI} callsets in many genomics studies.},

  abstract     = {About half of all cancers have somatic integrations of retrotransposons. To characterize their role in oncogenesis, we analyzed the patterns and mechanisms of somatic retrotransposition in 2,954 cancer genomes from 37 histological cancer subtypes. We identified 19,166 somatically acquired retrotransposition events, affecting 35\% of samples, and spanning a range of event types. L1 insertions emerged as the first most frequent type of somatic structural variation in esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the second most frequent in head-and-neck and colorectal cancers. Aberrant L1 integrations can delete megabase-scale regions of a chromosome, sometimes removing tumour suppressor genes, as well as inducing complex translocations and large-scale duplications. Somatic retrotranspositions can also initiate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, leading to high-level amplification of oncogenes. These observations illuminate a relevant role of L1 retrotransposition in remodelling the cancer genome, with potential implications in the development of human tumours.},

  abstract     = {Motivation: Structural variants are defined as genomic variants larger than 50bp. They have been shown to affect more bases in any given genome than {SNPs} or small indels. Additionally, they have great impact on human phenotype and diversity and have been linked to numerous dis- eases. Due to their size and association with repeats, they are difficult to detect by shotgun sequencing, especially when based on short reads. Long read, single molecule sequencing technologies like those offered by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies produce reads with a length of several thousand base pairs. Despite the higher error rate and sequencing cost, long read sequencing offers many advantages for the detection of structural variants. Yet, available software tools still do not fully exploit the possibilities. Results: We present {SVIM}, a tool for the sensitive detection and precise characterization of structural variants from long read data. {SVIM} con- sists of three components for the collection, clustering and combination of structural variant signatures from read alignments. It discriminates five different variant classes including similar types, such as tandem and interspersed duplications and novel element insertions. {SVIM} is unique in its capability of extracting both the genomic origin and destination of duplications. It compares favorably with existing tools in evaluations on simulated data and real datasets from {PacBio} and Nanopore sequencing machines. Availability and implementation: The source code and executables of {SVIM} are available on Github: github.com/eldariont/svim. {SVIM} has been implemented in Python 3 and published on bioconda and the Python Package Index.},

Here we present a new experimental approach {MeSMLR}-seq (methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing) for long-range mapping of nucleosomes and chromatin accessibility at single {DNA} molecules, and thus achieve comprehensive-coverage characterization of the corresponding heterogeneity. We applied {MeSMLR}-seq to haploid yeast, where single {DNA} molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding transcription start site for silently- and actively-transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin statuses spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell {RNA}-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly-heterogeneous scenario. Moreover, we quantified the openness of promoters and investigated the coupled chromatin changes of adjacent genes at single {DNA} molecules during transcription reprogramming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract     = {Transposable elements ({TEs}) represent a substantial fraction of many eukaryotic genomes, and transcriptional regulation of these factors is important to determine {TE} activities in human cells. However, due to the repetitive nature of {TEs}, identifying transcription factor ({TF})-binding sites from {ChIP}-sequencing ({ChIP}-seq) datasets is challenging. Current algorithms are focused on subtle differences between {TE} copies and thus bias the analysis to relatively old and inactive {TEs}. Here we describe an approach termed "{MapRRCon}" (mapping repeat reads to a consensus) which allows us to identify proteins binding to {TE} {DNA} sequences by mapping {ChIP}-seq reads to the {TE} consensus sequence after whole-genome alignment. Although this method does not assign binding sites to individual insertions in the genome, it provides a landscape of interacting {TFs} by capturing factors that bind to {TEs} under various conditions. We applied this method to screen {TFs}' interaction with L1 in human cells/tissues using {ENCODE} {ChIP}-seq datasets and identified 178 of the 512 {TFs} tested as bound to L1 in at least one biological condition with most of them (138) localized to the promoter. Among these L1-binding factors, we focused on Myc and {CTCF}, as they play important roles in cancer progression and 3D chromatin structure formation. Furthermore, we explored the transcriptomes of The Cancer Genome Atlas breast and ovarian tumor samples in which a consistent anti-/correlation between L1 and Myc/{CTCF} expression was observed, suggesting that these two factors may play roles in regulating L1 transcription during the development of such tumors.},

  abstract     = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The activity of the retrotransposon {LINE}-1 has created a substantial portion of the human genome. Most of this sequence comprises fractured and debilitated {LINE}-1s. An accurate approximation of the number, location, and sequence of the {LINE}-1 elements present in any single genome has proven elusive due to the difficulty of assembling and phasing the repetitive and polymorphic regions of the human genome. Through an in-depth analysis of publicly-available, deep, long-read assemblies of nearly homozygous human genomes, we defined the location and sequence of all intact {LINE}-1s in these assemblies. We found 148 and 142 intact {LINE}-1s in two nearly homozygous assemblies. A combination of these assemblies suggests a diploid human genome contains at least 50\% more intact {LINE}-1s than previous estimates - in this case, 290 intact {LINE}-1s at 194 loci. We think this is the best approximation, to date, of the number of intact {LINE}-1s in a single diploid human genome. In addition to counting intact {LINE}-1 elements, we resolved the sequence of each element, including some {LINE}-1 elements in unassembled, presumably centromeric regions of the genome. A comparison of the intact {LINE}-1s in each assembly shows the specific pattern of variation between these genomes, including {LINE}-1s that remain intact in only one genome, allelic variation in shared intact {LINE}-1s, and {LINE}-1s that are unique (presumably young) insertions in only one genome. We found that many old elements (\&gt; 6 million years old) remain intact, and comparison of the young and intact {LINE}-1s across assemblies reinforces the notion that only a small portion of all {LINE}-1 sequences that may be intact in the genomes of the human population has been uncovered. This dataset provides the first nearly comprehensive estimate of {LINE}-1 diversity within an individual, an important dataset in the quest to understand the functional consequences of sequence variation in {LINE}-1 and the complete set of {LINE}-1s in the human population.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We have demonstrated the ability of this method to generate median 165X coverage at 10 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb from a single flow cell, which represents a several hundred fold improvement over the 2-3X coverage achieved without enrichment. Using a panel of guide {RNAs}, we show that the high coverage data from this method enables us to (1) profile {DNA} methylation patterns at cancer driver genes, (2) detect structural variations at known hot spots, and (3) survey for the presence of single nucleotide mutations. Together, this provides a low-cost method that can be applied even in low resource settings to directly examine cellular {DNA}. This technique has extensive clinical applications for assessing medically relevant genes and has the versatility to be a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate applications of this technique by examining the well characterized {GM}12878 cell line as well as three breast cell lines ({MCF}-10A, {MCF}-7, {MDA}-{MB}-231) with varying tumorigenic potential as a model for cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract     = {The methylcytosine oxidase {TET} proteins play important roles in {DNA} demethylation and development. However, it remains elusive how exactly they target substrates and execute oxidation. Interestingly, we found that, in mice, the full-length {TET}1 isoform ({TET}1e) is restricted to early embryos, embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}), and primordial germ cells ({PGCs}). By contrast, a short isoform ({TET}1s) is preferentially expressed in somatic cells, which lacks the N terminus including the {CXXC} domain, a {DNA}-binding module that often recognizes {CpG} islands ({CGIs}) where {TET}1 predominantly occupies. Unexpectedly, {TET}1s can still bind {CGIs} despite the fact that its global chromatin binding is signiﬁcantly reduced. Interestingly, global chromatin binding, but not targeted binding at {CGIs}, is correlated with {TET}1-mediated demethylation. Finally, mice with exclusive expression of Tet1s failed to erase imprints in {PGCs} and displayed developmental defects in progeny. These data show that isoform switch of {TET}1 regulates epigenetic memory erasure and mouse development.},

It uses several newly developed algorithms which enable higher precision and recall of correctly detected transcripts and exon boundaries. We compared its performance with the state-of-the-art tools Minimap2 and Gmap. On both simulated and real datasets Graphmap2 achieves higher mappability and more correctly recognized exons and their ends. In addition we present an analysis of potential of splice aware mappers and long reads for the identification of previously unknown isoforms and even genes.

In 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies ({ONT}) launched a beta-testing program that supplied the scientific community with the first prototype of a nanopore sequencer: the {MinION}. Thanks to this program, several research groups had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of this novel instrument and develop novel computational approaches for analyzing this new generation of data. Despite the short period of time from the release of the {MinION}, a large number of algorithms and tools have been developed for base calling, data handling, read mapping, de novo assembly and variant discovery. Here, we face the main computational challenges related to the analysis of nanopore data, and we carry out a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the algorithmic solutions adopted by the bioinformatic community comparing performance and reporting limits and advantages of using this new generation of sequences for genomic analyses. Our analyses demonstrate that the use of nanopore data dramatically improves the de novo assembly of genomes and allows for the exploration of structural variants with an unprecedented accuracy and resolution. However, despite the impressive improvements reached by {ONT} in the past 2 years, the use of these data for small-variant calling is still challenging, and at present, it needs to be coupled with complementary short sequences for mitigating the intrinsic biases of nanopore sequencing technology.},
