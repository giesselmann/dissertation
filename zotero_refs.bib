  abstract = {Motivation: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time., Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both., Availability: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net, Contact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

  abstract = {Motivation: Nanopore-based sequencing techniques can reconstruct properties of biosequences by analyzing the sequence-dependent ionic current steps produced as biomolecules pass through a pore. Typically this involves alignment of new data to a reference, where both reference construction and alignment have been performed by hand., Results: We propose an automated method for aligning nanopore data to a reference through the use of hidden Markov models. Several features that arise from prior processing steps and from the class of enzyme used can be simply incorporated into the model. Previously, the M2MspA nanopore was shown to be sensitive enough to distinguish between cytosine, methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine. We validated our automated methodology on a subset of that data by automatically calculating an error rate for the distinction between the three cytosine variants and show that the automated methodology produces a 2–3\% error rate, lower than the 10\% error rate from previous manual segmentation and alignment., Availability and implementation: The data, output, scripts and tutorials replicating the analysis are available at https://github.com/UCSCNanopore/Data/tree/master/Automation., Contact:

  abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying folding of mammalian chromosomes remain poorly understood. The transcription factor CTCF is a candidate regulator of chromosomal structure. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.},

The genome-wide localization and function of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in adult stem cells are unknown. Here, we show that in human epidermal stem cells, the two proteins bind in a histone H3K36me3-dependent manner to the most active enhancers and are required to produce their associated enhancer RNAs. Both proteins prefer super-enhancers associated to genes that either define the ectodermal lineage or establish the stem cell and differentiated states. However, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b differ in their mechanisms of enhancer regulation: Dnmt3a associates with p63 to maintain high levels of DNA hydroxymethylation at the center of enhancers in a Tet2-dependent manner, whereas Dnmt3b promotes DNA methylation along the body of the enhancer. Depletion of either protein inactivates their target enhancers and profoundly affects epidermal stem cell function. Altogether, we reveal novel functions for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b at enhancers that could contribute to their roles in disease and tumorigenesis.},

To that end, we performed comprehensive transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of populations derived through directed differentiation of hESCs representing each of the three embryonic germ layers. Integration of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and RNA sequencing reveals unique events associated with specification toward each lineage. Lineage-specific dynamic alterations in DNA methylation and H3K4me1 are evident at putative distal regulatory elements that are frequently bound by pluripotency factors in the undifferentiated hESCs. In addition, we identified germ-layer-specific H3K27me3 enrichment at sites exhibiting high DNA methylation in the undifferentiated state. A better understanding of these initial specification events will facilitate identification of deficiencies in current approaches, leading to more faithful differentiation strategies as well as providing insights into the rewiring of human regulatory programs during cellular transitions.},

  abstract = {In mammals, the canonical somatic DNA methylation landscape is established upon specification of the embryo proper and subsequently disrupted within many cancer types. However, the underlying mechanisms that direct this genome-scale transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its systematic acquisition or potential developmental utility. Here, we analysed global remethylation from the mouse preimplantation embryo into the early epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire highly divergent genomic distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG density-dependent methylation in the placental progenitor. The extraembryonic epigenome includes specific de novo methylation at hundreds of embryonically protected CpG island promoters, particularly those that are associated with key developmental regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human cancer types. Our data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of extraembryonic tissues may have required co-option of DNA methylation-based suppression as an alternative to regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which coordinate embryonic germ-layer formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this decision is made deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used-and frequently oncogenic-signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the spontaneous reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic landscape.},

Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories.},

Here we inactivated all three catalytically active DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to further investigate the roles and genomic targets of these enzymes. Disruption of DNMT3A or DNMT3B individually as well as of both enzymes in tandem results in viable, pluripotent cell lines with distinct effects on the DNA methylation landscape, as assessed by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Surprisingly, in contrast to findings in mouse, deletion of DNMT1 resulted in rapid cell death in human ESCs. To overcome this immediate lethality, we generated a doxycycline-responsive tTA-DNMT1* rescue line and readily obtained homozygous DNMT1-mutant lines. However, doxycycline-mediated repression of exogenous DNMT1* initiates rapid, global loss of DNA methylation, followed by extensive cell death. Our data provide a comprehensive characterization of DNMT-mutant ESCs, including single-base genome-wide maps of the targets of these enzymes.},

Here, we report the excessive frequency and apparent selectivity of retrotransposition of ES cell-specific genes. Six highly homologous pseudogenes for Oct4, 10 for Nanog, and 16 for Stella were identified by nucleotide BLAST (basic local alignment sequence tool) searches against the respective gene mRNA transcripts. Of 15 non-ES cell-specific transcription factor genes, only one had a single pseudogene hit in our screen, emphasizing the apparent selectivity. We present a hypothesis whereby retrotransposition of ES or germ cell-specific genes may reflect an innate predisposition. This is based on the increased probability of germ-line transmission when retrotransposition occurs at a very early stage of development within cells known to contribute to the germ cell lineage. The parental genes for Nanog, Stella, and another embryonic gene, GDF3 are all located on chromosome 12p13 of the human genome, and on chromosome 6 in mouse. Here, we identified an Oct4 pseudogene at the same respective loci in both human and mouse genomes, suggesting functional relevance and indicative of epigenetic regulation. We tested whether the apparent susceptibility for ES cell-specific gene retrotransposition may be extrapolated to a more unified phenomenon, such that a bioinformatic approach may represent a potentially novel strategy for identification of genes with embryonic cell-specific functionality. A preliminary investigation indeed revealed a single gene, previously demonstrated to be responsible for multiple retropseudogenes via germ cell-specific expression in Xenopus.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor Oct4 is well defined as a key regulator of embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. In recent years, the role of Oct4 has purportedly extended to the self renewal and maintenance of multipotency in adult stem cell (ASC) populations. This profile has arisen mainly from reports utilising reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based methodologies and has since come under scrutiny following the discovery that many developmental genes have multiple pseudogenes associated with them. Six known pseudogenes exist for Oct4, all of which exhibit very high sequence homology (three {\textgreater}97\%), and for this reason the generation of artefacts may have contributed to false identification of Oct4 in somatic cell populations. While ASC lack a molecular blueprint of transcription factors proposed to be involved with 'stemness' as described for ES cells, it is not unreasonable to assume that similar gene patterns may exist. The focus of this work was to corroborate reports that Oct4 is involved in the regulation of ASC self-renewal and differentiation, using a combination of methodologies to rule out pseudogene interference. Haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) derived from human umbilical cord blood (UCB) and various differentiated cell lines underwent RT-PCR, product sequencing and transfection studies using an Oct4 promoter-driven reporter. In summary, only the positive control expressed Oct4, with all other cell types expressing a variety of Oct4 pseudogenes. Somatic cells were incapable of utilising an exogenous Oct4 promoter construct, leading to the conclusion that Oct4 does not appear involved in the multipotency of human HSC from UCB.},

Heterochromatic regions are associated with histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) or H3K27me3, but these modifications are also found in euchromatic regions that permit transcription. We discovered that resistance to sonication is a reliable indicator of the heterochromatin state, and we developed a biophysical method (gradient-seq) to discriminate subtypes of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains in sonication-resistant heterochromatin (srHC) versus euchromatin. These classifications are more accurate than the histone marks alone in predicting transcriptional silence and resistance of alternate fate genes to activation during direct cell conversion. Our proteomics of H3K9me3-marked srHC and functional screens revealed diverse proteins, including RBMX and RBMXL1, that impede gene induction during cellular reprogramming. Isolation of srHC with gradient-seq provides a genome-wide map of chromatin structure, elucidating subtypes of repressed domains that are uniquely predictive of diverse other chromatin properties.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

With a growing number of partially or completely sequenced genomes, multiple alignment is playing an increasingly important role in these studies. In recent years, various tools for pair-wise and multiple genomic alignment have been proposed. Some of them are extremely fast, but often efficiency is achieved at the expense of sensitivity. One way of combining speed and sensitivity is to use an anchored-alignment approach. In a first step, a fast search program identifies a chain of strong local sequence similarities. In a second step, regions between these anchor points are aligned using a slower but more accurate method.},

  abstract   = {Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by nucleotide repeat expansions, but most expansions, like the C9orf72 'GGGGCC' (G4C2) repeat that causes approximately 5-7\% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, are too long to fully sequence using short-read sequencing technologies. It is unclear whether long-read sequencing technologies can traverse these long, challenging repeat expansions. Here, we demonstrate that two long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies', can sequence through disease-causing repeats cloned into plasmids, including the FTD/ALS-causing G4C2 repeat expansion. We also report the first long-read sequencing data characterizing the C9orf72 G4C2 repeat expansion at the nucleotide level in a symptomatic expansion carrier. Our findings indicate that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterizing known disease-causing repeat expansions, and for discovering new disease-causing or disease-modifying repeat expansions that have gone undetected with conventional short-read sequencing. Larger and deeper long-read sequencing studies in C9orf72 expansion carriers will be important to determine heterogeneity and whether the repeats are interrupted by non-G4C2 content, potentially mitigating or modifying the disease course or age of onset, as interruptions are known to do in other repeat-expansion disorders. These results have broad implications across all diseases where the genetic etiology remains unclear.},

  abstract  = {Transposable elements (TE) are an important source of evolutionary novelty in gene regulation. However, the mechanisms by which TEs contribute to gene expression are largely uncharacterized. Here, we leverage Roadmap and GTEx data to investigate the dynamics of TE recruitment in 24 tissues. We find 112 human TE types enriched in active regions of the genome across tissues. SINEs and DNA transposons are the most frequently enriched classes, while LTRs are often co-opted in a tissue specific manner. We report across-tissue variability in TE enrichment in active regions. Genes with consistent expression across tissues are less likely to be associated to TE insertions. TE repression similarly follows tissue specific patterns, and LTRs are the most abundant class in repressed regions. Different TE classes are preferentially silenced in different ways: LTRs and LINEs are overrepresented in regions marked by H3K9me3, while other TEs are preferentially repressed by H3K27me3. Young TEs are typically enriched in repressed regions and depleted in active regions. We detect multiple instances of TEs with tissue specific regulatory activity. Such TEs provide binding sites for transcription factors that are master regulators for the given tissue. These tissue specific activated TEs are enriched in intronic enhancers, and significantly affect the expression of the associated genes. Finally we show that SVAs can act as transcriptional activators or repressors in a tissue specific context. We provide an integrated overview of the contribution of TEs to human gene regulation. Expanding previous analyses, we demonstrate that TEs generate regulatory novelty in a tissue specific fashion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic sequences that randomly propagate within their host's genome. This mobility has the potential to affect gene transcription and cause disease. However, TEs are technically challenging to identify, which complicates efforts to assess the impact of TE insertions on disease. Here we present a targeted sequencing protocol and computational pipeline to identify polymorphic and novel TE insertions using next-generation sequencing: TE-NGS. The method simultaneously targets the three subfamilies that are responsible for the majority of recent TE activity (L1HS, AluYa5/8, and AluYb8/9) thereby obviating the need for multiple experiments and reducing the amount of input material required.
RESULTS: Here we describe the laboratory protocol and detection algorithm, and a benchmark experiment for the reference genome NA12878. We demonstrate a substantial enrichment for on-target fragments, and high sensitivity and precision to both reference and NA12878-specific insertions. We report 17 previously unreported loci for this individual which are supported by orthogonal long-read evidence, and we identify 1470 polymorphic and novel TEs in 12 additional samples that were previously undocumented in databases of insertion polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that future applications of TE-NGS alongside exome sequencing of patients with sporadic disease will reduce the number of unresolved cases, and improve estimates of the contribution of TEs to human genetic disease.},

Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the noncoding region of the C9ORF72 gene are the most common cause of the familial form of ALS (C9-ALS), as well as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and other neurological diseases. How the repeat expansion causes disease remains unclear, with both loss of function (haploinsufficiency) and gain of function (either toxic RNA or protein products) proposed. We report a cellular model of C9-ALS with motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from ALS patients carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. No significant loss of C9ORF72 expression was observed, and knockdown of the transcript was not toxic to cultured human motor neurons. Transcription of the repeat was increased, leading to accumulation of GGGGCC repeat–containing RNA foci selectively in C9-ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons. Repeat-containing RNA foci colocalized with hnRNPA1 and Pur-α, suggesting that they may be able to alter RNA metabolism. C9-ALS motor neurons showed altered expression of genes involved in membrane excitability including DPP6, and demonstrated a diminished capacity to fire continuous spikes upon depolarization compared to control motor neurons. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the C9ORF72 transcript suppressed RNA foci formation and reversed gene expression alterations in C9-ALS motor neurons. These data show that patient-derived motor neurons can be used to delineate pathogenic events in ALS.
Antisense oligonucleotides can correct disease-specific phenotypes in cultured motor neurons differentiated from iPSCs derived from ALS patients with a C9ORF72 repeat expansion.

  abstract  = {Long-reads, point-of-care, and PCR-free are the promises brought by nanopore sequencing. Among various steps in nanopore data analysis, the global mapping between the raw electrical current signal sequence and the expected signal sequence from the pore model serves as the key building block to base calling, reads mapping, variant identification, and methylation detection. However, the ultra-long reads of nanopore sequencing and an order of magnitude difference in the sampling speeds of the two sequences make the classical dynamic time warping (DTW) and its variants infeasible to solve the problem. Here, we propose a novel multi-level DTW algorithm, cwDTW, based on continuous wavelet transforms with different scales of the two signal sequences. Our algorithm starts from low-resolution wavelet transforms of the two sequences, such that the transformed sequences are short and have similar sampling rates. Then the peaks and nadirs of the transformed sequences are extracted to form feature sequences with similar lengths, which can be easily mapped by the original DTW. Our algorithm then recursively projects the warping path from a lower-resolution level to a higher-resolution one by building a context-dependent boundary and enabling a constrained search for the warping path in the latter. Comprehensive experiments on two real nanopore datasets on human and on Pandoraea pnomenusa, as well as two benchmark datasets from previous studies, demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In particular, cwDTW can almost always generate warping paths that are very close to the original DTW, which are remarkably more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods including FastDTW and PrunedDTW. Meanwhile, on the real nanopore datasets, cwDTW is about 440 times faster than FastDTW and 3000 times faster than the original DTW. Our program is available at https://github.com/realbigws/cwDTW.},

Recent research has shown that nanopore sequencing can detect m5C with per-read accuracy of upwards of 80\% but m6A with significantly lower accuracy.

  abstract   = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons represent approximately one sixth of the human genome, but only the human-specific L1HS-Ta subfamily acts as an endogenous mutagen in modern humans, reshaping both somatic and germline genomes. Due to their high levels of sequence identity and the existence of many polymorphic insertions absent from the reference genome, the transcriptional activation of individual genomic L1HS-Ta copies remains poorly understood. Here we comprehensively mapped fixed and polymorphic L1HS-Ta copies in 12 commonly-used somatic cell lines, and identified transcriptional and epigenetic signatures allowing the unambiguous identification of active L1HS-Ta copies in their genomic context. Strikingly, only a very restricted subset of L1HS-Ta loci - some being polymorphic among individuals - significantly contributes to the bulk of L1 expression, and these loci are differentially regulated among distinct cell lines. Thus, our data support a local model of L1 transcriptional activation in somatic cells, governed by individual-, locus-, and cell-type-specific determinants., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13926.001, Retrotransposons, also known as jumping genes, have invaded the genomes of most living organisms. These fragments of DNA have the ability to move or copy themselves from one location of a chromosome to another. Depending on where they insert themselves, retrotransposons can modify the sequence of nearby genes, which can alter or even abolish their activity. Although these genetic modifications have contributed significantly to the evolution of different species, retrotransposons can also have detrimental effects; for example, by causing new cases of genetic diseases., Adult human cells have a number of mechanisms that work to keep the activity of retrotransposons at a very low level. However, in many types of cancers retrotransposons escape these defense mechanisms and ‘jump’ actively. This is thought to contribute to the development and spread of cancerous tumors., To understand how jumping genes are mobilized, a fundamental question must be answered: is the high jumping gene activity observed in some cell types a result of activating many copies of the retrotransposons, or only a few of them? This question has been difficult to address because there are more than one hundred copies of retrotransposons that could potentially move in humans, many of which have not even been referenced in the human genome map. Furthermore, each copy is almost identical to another one, making it difficult to discriminate between them., Philippe et al. have now developed an approach that can map where individual retrotransposons are located in the genome of normal and cancerous cells and measure how active these jumping genes are. This revealed that only a very restricted number of them are active in any given cell type. Moreover, different subsets of jumping genes are active in different cell types, and their locations in the genome often do not overlap., Thus, whether jumping genes are activated depends on the cell type and their position in the genome. These results are in contrast to the prevalent view that retrotransposons are activated in a more widespread manner across the genome, at least in cancerous cells. Overall, Philippe et al.’s findings pave the way towards characterizing the chromosome regions in which retrotransposons are frequently activated and understanding how they contribute to cancer and other diseases., DOI:

  abstract  = {DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation, development and disease. Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA–protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation plays an important role in development and disease. The primary sites of DNA methylation in vertebrates are cytosines in the CpG dinucleotide context, which account for roughly three quarters of the total DNA methylation content in human and mouse cells. While the genomic distribution, inter-individual stability, and functional role of CpG methylation are reasonably well understood, little is known about DNA methylation targeting CpA, CpT, and CpC (non-CpG) dinucleotides. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of non-CpG methylation in 76 genome-scale DNA methylation maps across pluripotent and differentiated human cell types. We confirm non-CpG methylation to be predominantly present in pluripotent cell types and observe a decrease upon differentiation and near complete absence in various somatic cell types. Although no function has been assigned to it in pluripotency, our data highlight that non-CpG methylation patterns reappear upon iPS cell reprogramming. Intriguingly, the patterns are highly variable and show little conservation between different pluripotent cell lines. We find a strong correlation of non-CpG methylation and DNMT3 expression levels while showing statistical independence of non-CpG methylation from pluripotency associated gene expression. In line with these findings, we show that knockdown of DNMTA and DNMT3B in hESCs results in a global reduction of non-CpG methylation. Finally, non-CpG methylation appears to be spatially correlated with CpG methylation. In summary these results contribute further to our understanding of cytosine methylation patterns in human cells using a large representative sample set.},

  abstract  = {Bivalent (poised or paused) chromatin comprises activating and repressing histone modifications at the same location. This combination of epigenetic marks at promoter or enhancer regions keeps genes expressed at low levels but poised for rapid activation. Typically, DNA at bivalent promoters is only lowly methylated in normal cells, but frequently shows elevated methylation levels in cancer samples. Here, we developed a universal classifier built from chromatin data that can identify cancer samples solely from hypermethylation of bivalent chromatin. Tested on over 7,000 DNA methylation data sets from several cancer types, it reaches an AUC of 0.92. Although higher levels of DNA methylation are often associated with transcriptional silencing, counter-intuitive positive statistical dependencies between DNA methylation and expression levels have been recently reported for two cancer types. Here, we re-analyze combined expression and DNA methylation data sets, comprising over 5,000 samples, and demonstrate that the conjunction of hypermethylation of bivalent chromatin and up-regulation of the corresponding genes is a general phenomenon in cancer. This up-regulation affects many developmental genes and transcription factors, including dozens of homeobox genes and other genes implicated in cancer. Thus, we reason that the disturbance of bivalent chromatin may be intimately linked to tumorigenesis.},

We show experimentally that all common RNN architectures achieve nearly the same per-task and per-unit capacity bounds with careful training, for a variety of tasks and stacking depths. They can store an amount of task information which is linear in the number of parameters, and is approximately 5 bits per parameter. They can additionally store approximately one real number from their input history per hidden unit. We further ﬁnd that for several tasks it is the per-task parameter capacity bound that determines performance. These results suggest that many previous results comparing RNN architectures are driven primarily by differences in training effectiveness, rather than differences in capacity. Supporting this observation, we compare training difﬁculty for several architectures, and show that vanilla RNNs are far more difﬁcult to train, yet have slightly higher capacity. Finally, we propose two novel RNN architectures, one of which is easier to train than the LSTM or GRU for deeply stacked architectures.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

  abstract = {Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain \$X\$ to a target domain \$Y\$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping \$G: X {\textbackslash}rightarrow Y\$ such that the distribution of images from \$G(X)\$ is indistinguishable from the distribution \$Y\$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping \$F: Y {\textbackslash}rightarrow X\$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push \$F(G(X)) {\textbackslash}approx X\$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

Nanoraw accurately assigns contiguous raw nanopore signal to genomic positions, enabling novel data visualization, and increasing power and accuracy for the discovery of covalently modified bases in native DNA. Ground truth case studies utilizing synthetically methylated DNA show the capacity to identify three distinct methylation marks, 4mC, 5mC, and 6mA, in seven distinct sequence contexts without any changes to the algorithm. We demonstrate quantitative reproducibility simultaneously identifying 5mC and 6mA in native E. coli across biological replicates processed in different labs. Finally we propose a pipeline for the comprehensive discovery of DNA modifications in any genome without a priori knowledge of their chemical identities.},

In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where ADAM does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of ADAM algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be ﬁxed by endowing such algorithms with “long-term memory” of past gradients, and propose new variants of the ADAM algorithm which not only ﬁx the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

These methods tend to perform well in the initial portion of training but are outperformed by SGD at later stages of training. We investigate a hybrid strategy that begins training with an adaptive method and switches to SGD when appropriate. Concretely, we propose SWATS, a simple strategy which switches from Adam to SGD when a triggering condition is satisfied. The condition we propose relates to the projection of Adam steps on the gradient subspace. By design, the monitoring process for this condition adds very little overhead and does not increase the number of hyperparameters in the optimizer. We report experiments on several standard benchmarks such as: ResNet, SENet, DenseNet and PyramidNet for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets, ResNet on the tiny-ImageNet data set and language modeling with recurrent networks on the PTB and WT2 data sets. The results show that our strategy is capable of closing the generalization gap between SGD and Adam on a majority of the tasks.},

  abstract  = {Tandem repeats (TRs) can cause disease through their length, sequence motif interruptions, and nucleotide modifications. For many TRs, however, these features are very difficult - if not impossible - to assess, requiring low-throughput and labor-intensive assays. One example is a VNTR in ABCA7 for which we recently discovered that expanded alleles strongly increase risk of Alzheimer′s disease. Here, we investigated the potential of long-read whole genome sequencing to surmount these challenges, using the high-throughput PromethION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. To overcome the limitations of conventional base calling and alignment, we developed an algorithm to study the TR size and sequence directly on raw PromethION current data. We report the long-read sequencing of multiple human genomes (n = 11) using only a single sequencing run and flow cell per individual. With the use of fresh DNA extractions, DNA shearing to approximately 20kb and size selection, we obtained an average output of 70 gigabases (Gb) per flow cell, corresponding to a 21x genome coverage, and a maximum yield of 98 Gb (30x genome coverage). All ABCA7 VNTR alleles, including expansions up to 10,000 bases, were spanned by long sequencing reads, validated by Southern blotting. Classical approaches of TR length estimation suffered from low accuracy, low precision, DNA strand effects and/or inability to call pathogenic repeat expansions. In contrast, our novel NanoSatellite algorithm, which circumvents base calling by using dynamic time warping on raw PromethION current data, achieved more than 90\% accuracy and high precision (5.6\% relative standard deviation) of TR length estimation, and detected all clinically relevant repeat expansions. In addition, we identified alternative TR sequence motifs with high consistency, allowing determination of TR sequence and distinction of VNTR alleles with homozygous length. In conclusion, we validated the robustness of single-experiment whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, a prerequisite for application of long-read sequencing in the clinic. In addition, we outperformed Southern blotting, enabling improved characterization of the role of expanded ABCA7 VNTR alleles in Alzheimer′s disease, and opening new opportunities for TR research.},

Using this method, we detect BrdU incorporated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal, at a genomic scale and on single molecules, the DNA sequences replicated during a pulse labelling period. Under conditions of limiting BrdU concentration, D-NAscent detects the differences in BrdU incorporation frequency across individual molecules to reveal the location of active replication origins, fork direction, termination sites, and fork pausing/stalling events.

  abstract   = {Long read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore can greatly decrease the complexity of de novo genome assembly and large structural variation identification. Currently Nanopore reads have high error rates, and the errors often cluster into low-quality segments within the reads. Many methods for resolving these errors require access to reference genomes, high-fidelity short reads, or reference genomes, which are often not available. De novo error correction modules are available, often as part of assembly tools, but large-scale errors still remain in resulting assemblies, motivating further innovation in this area. We developed a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method, called MiniScrub, for de novo identification and subsequent "scrubbing" (removal) of low-quality Nanopore read segments. MiniScrub first generates read-to-read alignments by MiniMap, then encodes the alignments into images, and finally builds CNN models to predict low-quality segments that could be scrubbed based on a customized quality cutoff. Applying MiniScrub to real world control datasets under several different parameters, we show that it robustly improves read quality. Compared to raw reads, de novo genome assembly with scrubbed reads produces many fewer mis-assemblies and large indel errors. We propose MiniScrub as a tool for preprocessing Nanopore reads for downstream analyses. MiniScrub is open-source software and is available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-miniscrub},

  abstract  = {Pairwise alignment of nucleotide sequences has been calculated in practice by the seed-and-extend strategy, where we enumerate seeds (shared patterns) between sequences and then extend the seeds by a Smith-Waterman-like semi-global dynamic programming to obtain full pairwise alignments. With the advent of massively parallel short read sequencers, algorithms and data structures for efficiently finding seeds had been explored extensively. However, recent advances in single-molecule sequencing technologies enabled us to obtain millions of reads, each of which is orders of magnitude longer than those output by the short-read sequencers, demanding a faster algorithm for the extension step that dominates the computation time in pairwise local alignment. Our goal is to design a faster extension algorithm which overcomes the two major drawbacks of the single-molecule sequencers that the sequencing error rates is high (e.g., 10-15\%) and insertions and deletions are more frequent than substitutions are. We propose an adaptive banded dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for calculating pairwise semi-global alignment of nucleotide sequences that allows a relatively high insertion or deletion rate while maintaining the band width to some small constant (e.g., 32 cells). On every band advancing operation, cells at the forefront of the band are calculated simultaneously without mutual dependencies, allowing an efficient Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) parallelization. We show by an experiment that our algorithm runs approximately 8 times faster than the extension alignment algorithm in NCBI BLAST+ retaining the similar sensitivity and accuracy. The results indicate that the algorithm is capable of replacing extension alignment routines in the existing nucleotide local alignment programs.},

  abstract  = {Systematic variation in the methylation of cytosines at CpG sites plays a critical role in early development of humans and other mammals. Of particular interest are regions of differential methylation between parental alleles, as these often dictate monoallelic gene expression, resulting in parent of origin specific control of the embryonic transcriptome and subsequent development, in a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we show that, with an average genomic coverage of approximately ten, it is possible to determine both the level of methylation of CpG sites and the haplotype from which each read arises. The long-read property is exploited to characterise, using novel methods, both methylation and haplotype for reads that have reduced basecalling precision compared to Sanger sequencing. We validate the analysis both through comparison of nanopore-derived methylation patterns with those from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data and through comparison with previously reported data. Our analysis successfully identifies known imprinting control regions as well as some novel differentially methylated regions which, due to their proximity to hitherto unknown monoallelically expressed genes, may represent new imprinting control regions.},

  abstract   = {Multiplexing, the simultaneous sequencing of multiple barcoded DNA samples on a single flow cell, has made Oxford Nanopore sequencing cost-effective for small genomes. However, it depends on the ability to sort the resulting sequencing reads by barcode, and current demultiplexing tools fail to classify many reads. Here we present Deepbinner, a tool for Oxford Nanopore demultiplexing that uses a deep neural network to classify reads based on the raw electrical read signal. This ‘signal-space’ approach allows for greater accuracy than existing ‘base-space’ tools (Albacore and Porechop) for which signals must first be converted to DNA base calls, itself a complex problem that can introduce noise into the barcode sequence. To assess Deepbinner and existing tools, we performed multiplex sequencing on 12 amplicons chosen for their distinguishability. This allowed us to establish a ground truth classification for each read based on internal sequence alone. Deepbinner had the lowest rate of unclassified reads (7.8\%) and the highest demultiplexing precision (98.5\% of classified reads were correctly assigned). It can be used alone (to maximise the number of classified reads) or in conjunction with other demultiplexers (to maximise precision and minimise false positive classifications). We also found cross-sample chimeric reads (0.3\%) and evidence of barcode switching (0.3\%) in our dataset, which likely arise during library preparation and may be detrimental for quantitative studies that use multiplexing. Deepbinner is open source (GPLv3) and available at https://github.com/rrwick/Deepbinner.},

Herein, we propose Realignment-based Mobile Element insertion detection Tool for Long read (rMETL). rMETL takes advantage of its novel chimeric read re-alignment approach to well handle complex MEI signals. Benchmarking results on simulated and real datasets demonstrated that rMETL has the ability to more sensitivity discover MEIs as well as prevent false positives. It is suited to produce high quality MEI callsets in many genomics studies.},

To characterize their role in oncogenesis, we analyzed the patterns and mechanisms of somatic retrotransposition in 2,954 cancer genomes from 37 histological cancer subtypes. We identified 19,166 somatically acquired retrotransposition events, affecting 35\% of samples, and spanning a range of event types. L1 insertions emerged as the first most frequent type of somatic structural variation in esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the second most frequent in head-and-neck and colorectal cancers. Aberrant L1 integrations can delete megabase-scale regions of a chromosome, sometimes removing tumour suppressor genes, as well as inducing complex translocations and large-scale duplications. Somatic retrotranspositions can also initiate breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, leading to high-level amplification of oncogenes. These observations illuminate a relevant role of L1 retrotransposition in remodelling the cancer genome, with potential implications in the development of human tumours.},

  abstract   = {Motivation: Structural variants are defined as genomic variants larger than 50bp. They have been shown to affect more bases in any given genome than SNPs or small indels. Additionally, they have great impact on human phenotype and diversity and have been linked to numerous dis- eases. Due to their size and association with repeats, they are difficult to detect by shotgun sequencing, especially when based on short reads. Long read, single molecule sequencing technologies like those offered by Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies produce reads with a length of several thousand base pairs. Despite the higher error rate and sequencing cost, long read sequencing offers many advantages for the detection of structural variants. Yet, available software tools still do not fully exploit the possibilities. Results: We present SVIM, a tool for the sensitive detection and precise characterization of structural variants from long read data. SVIM con- sists of three components for the collection, clustering and combination of structural variant signatures from read alignments. It discriminates five different variant classes including similar types, such as tandem and interspersed duplications and novel element insertions. SVIM is unique in its capability of extracting both the genomic origin and destination of duplications. It compares favorably with existing tools in evaluations on simulated data and real datasets from PacBio and Nanopore sequencing machines. Availability and implementation: The source code and executables of SVIM are available on Github: github.com/eldariont/svim. SVIM has been implemented in Python 3 and published on bioconda and the Python Package Index.},

Here we present a new experimental approach MeSMLR-seq (methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing) for long-range mapping of nucleosomes and chromatin accessibility at single DNA molecules, and thus achieve comprehensive-coverage characterization of the corresponding heterogeneity. We applied MeSMLR-seq to haploid yeast, where single DNA molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding transcription start site for silently- and actively-transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin statuses spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell RNA-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly-heterogeneous scenario. Moreover, we quantified the openness of promoters and investigated the coupled chromatin changes of adjacent genes at single DNA molecules during transcription reprogramming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the following piece, we outline the history, properties, and pitfalls of the current human reference genome. In a few illustrative analyses, we focus on its use for variant-calling, highlighting its nearness to a "type specimen". We suggest that switching to a consensus reference offers important advantages over the current reference with few disadvantages.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) represent a substantial fraction of many eukaryotic genomes, and transcriptional regulation of these factors is important to determine TE activities in human cells. However, due to the repetitive nature of TEs, identifying transcription factor (TF)-binding sites from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets is challenging. Current algorithms are focused on subtle differences between TE copies and thus bias the analysis to relatively old and inactive TEs. Here we describe an approach termed "MapRRCon" (mapping repeat reads to a consensus) which allows us to identify proteins binding to TE DNA sequences by mapping ChIP-seq reads to the TE consensus sequence after whole-genome alignment. Although this method does not assign binding sites to individual insertions in the genome, it provides a landscape of interacting TFs by capturing factors that bind to TEs under various conditions. We applied this method to screen TFs' interaction with L1 in human cells/tissues using ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets and identified 178 of the 512 TFs tested as bound to L1 in at least one biological condition with most of them (138) localized to the promoter. Among these L1-binding factors, we focused on Myc and CTCF, as they play important roles in cancer progression and 3D chromatin structure formation. Furthermore, we explored the transcriptomes of The Cancer Genome Atlas breast and ovarian tumor samples in which a consistent anti-/correlation between L1 and Myc/CTCF expression was observed, suggesting that these two factors may play roles in regulating L1 transcription during the development of such tumors.},

  abstract  = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The activity of the retrotransposon LINE-1 has created a substantial portion of the human genome. Most of this sequence comprises fractured and debilitated LINE-1s. An accurate approximation of the number, location, and sequence of the LINE-1 elements present in any single genome has proven elusive due to the difficulty of assembling and phasing the repetitive and polymorphic regions of the human genome. Through an in-depth analysis of publicly-available, deep, long-read assemblies of nearly homozygous human genomes, we defined the location and sequence of all intact LINE-1s in these assemblies. We found 148 and 142 intact LINE-1s in two nearly homozygous assemblies. A combination of these assemblies suggests a diploid human genome contains at least 50\% more intact LINE-1s than previous estimates - in this case, 290 intact LINE-1s at 194 loci. We think this is the best approximation, to date, of the number of intact LINE-1s in a single diploid human genome. In addition to counting intact LINE-1 elements, we resolved the sequence of each element, including some LINE-1 elements in unassembled, presumably centromeric regions of the genome. A comparison of the intact LINE-1s in each assembly shows the specific pattern of variation between these genomes, including LINE-1s that remain intact in only one genome, allelic variation in shared intact LINE-1s, and LINE-1s that are unique (presumably young) insertions in only one genome. We found that many old elements (\&gt; 6 million years old) remain intact, and comparison of the young and intact LINE-1s across assemblies reinforces the notion that only a small portion of all LINE-1 sequences that may be intact in the genomes of the human population has been uncovered. This dataset provides the first nearly comprehensive estimate of LINE-1 diversity within an individual, an important dataset in the quest to understand the functional consequences of sequence variation in LINE-1 and the complete set of LINE-1s in the human population.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract  = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Nanopore sequencing technology offers a significant advancement through its ability to rapidly and directly interrogate native DNA molecules. Often we are interested only in interrogating specific areas at high depth, but this has proved challenging for long read sequencing with conventional enrichment methods. Existing strategies are currently limited by high input DNA requirements, low yield, short (\&lt;5kb) reads, time-intensive protocols, and/or amplification or cloning (losing base modification information). In this paper, we describe a technique utilizing the ability of Cas9 to introduce cuts at specific locations and ligating nanopore sequencing adaptors directly to those sites, a method we term 9nanopore Cas9 Targeted-Sequencing9 (nCATS). We have demonstrated the ability of this method to generate median 165X coverage at 10 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb from a single flow cell, which represents a several hundred fold improvement over the 2-3X coverage achieved without enrichment. Using a panel of guide RNAs, we show that the high coverage data from this method enables us to (1) profile DNA methylation patterns at cancer driver genes, (2) detect structural variations at known hot spots, and (3) survey for the presence of single nucleotide mutations. Together, this provides a low-cost method that can be applied even in low resource settings to directly examine cellular DNA. This technique has extensive clinical applications for assessing medically relevant genes and has the versatility to be a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate applications of this technique by examining the well characterized GM12878 cell line as well as three breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) with varying tumorigenic potential as a model for cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Interestingly, we found that, in mice, the full-length TET1 isoform (TET1e) is restricted to early embryos, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and primordial germ cells (PGCs). By contrast, a short isoform (TET1s) is preferentially expressed in somatic cells, which lacks the N terminus including the CXXC domain, a DNA-binding module that often recognizes CpG islands (CGIs) where TET1 predominantly occupies. Unexpectedly, TET1s can still bind CGIs despite the fact that its global chromatin binding is signiﬁcantly reduced. Interestingly, global chromatin binding, but not targeted binding at CGIs, is correlated with TET1-mediated demethylation. Finally, mice with exclusive expression of Tet1s failed to erase imprints in PGCs and displayed developmental defects in progeny. These data show that isoform switch of TET1 regulates epigenetic memory erasure and mouse development.},

  abstract   = {The nanopore sequencing process is based on the transit of a DNA molecule through a nanoscopic pore, and since the 90s is considered as one of the most promising approaches to detect polymeric molecules. In 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) launched a beta-testing program that supplied the scientific community with the first prototype of a nanopore sequencer: the MinION. Thanks to this program, several research groups had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of this novel instrument and develop novel computational approaches for analyzing this new generation of data. Despite the short period of time from the release of the MinION, a large number of algorithms and tools have been developed for base calling, data handling, read mapping, de novo assembly and variant discovery. Here, we face the main computational challenges related to the analysis of nanopore data, and we carry out a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the algorithmic solutions adopted by the bioinformatic community comparing performance and reporting limits and advantages of using this new generation of sequences for genomic analyses. Our analyses demonstrate that the use of nanopore data dramatically improves the de novo assembly of genomes and allows for the exploration of structural variants with an unprecedented accuracy and resolution. However, despite the impressive improvements reached by ONT in the past 2 years, the use of these data for small-variant calling is still challenging, and at present, it needs to be coupled with complementary short sequences for mitigating the intrinsic biases of nanopore sequencing technology.},

This same repeat expansion was identified in the majority of our families with a combined FTD/ALS phenotype and TDP-43-based pathology. Analysis of extended clinical series found the C9ORF72 repeat expansion to be the most common genetic abnormality in both familial FTD (11.7\%) and familial ALS (23.5\%). The repeat expansion leads to the loss of one alternatively spliced C9ORF72 transcript and to formation of nuclear RNA foci, suggesting multiple disease mechanisms. Our findings indicate that repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of both FTD and ALS.},

We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the Finnish population, underlying 46.0\% of familial ALS and 21.1\% of sporadic ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87\% of familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date.},

Genetic testing for C9orf72 expansions in patients with ALS and/or FTD and their relatives has become increasingly available since hexanucleotide repeat expansions were first reported in 2011. The repeat number is highly variable and the threshold at which repeat size leads to neurodegeneration remains unknown. We present the case of an ALS patient who underwent genetic testing through our Motor Neurone Disease Clinic. We highlight current limitations to analysing and interpreting C9orf72 expansion test results and describe how this resulted in discordant reports of pathogenicity between testing laboratories that confounded the genetic counselling process. We conclude that patients with ALS or FTD and their at-risk family members, need to be adequately counselled about the limitations of current knowledge to ensure they are making informed decisions about genetic testing for C9orf72. Greater collaboration between clinicians, testing laboratories and researchers is required to ensure risks to patients and their families are minimised.},

Common themes have emerged within and between these different classes of disease; for example, among disorders that are caused by gain-of-function mechanisms, altered protein conformations are central to pathogenesis, leading to changes in protein activity or abundance. In all these diseases, the context of the expanded repeat and the abundance, subcellular localization and interactions of the proteins and RNAs that are affected have key roles in disease-specific phenotypes.},

Expanded trinucleotide repeat diseases were discovered first and remain the most frequent. More recently tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and even dodeca-nucleotide repeat expansions have been identified as the cause of human disease, including some of the most common genetic disorders seen by neurologists. Repeat expansion diseases include both causes of myotonic dystrophy (DM1 and DM2), the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (C9ORF72), Huntington disease, and eight other polyglutamine disorders, including the most common forms of dominantly inherited ataxia, the most common recessive ataxia (Friedreich ataxia), and the most common heritable mental retardation (fragile X syndrome). Here I review distinctive features of this group of diseases that stem from the unusual, dynamic nature of the underlying mutations. These features include marked clinical heterogeneity and the phenomenon of clinical anticipation. I then discuss the diverse molecular mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis, which vary depending on the repeat sequence, size, and location within the disease gene, and whether the repeat is translated into protein. I conclude with a brief clinical and genetic description of individual repeat expansion diseases that are most relevant to neurologists.},

Within a 7.4 kb EcoRI genomic fragment, containing FMR-1 exonic sequences distal to a CpG island previously shown to be hypermethylated in fragile X patients, is a fragile X site-induced breakpoint cluster region that exhibits length variation in fragile X chromosomes. This fragment contains a lengthy CGG repeat that is 250 bp distal of the CpG island and maps within a FMR-1 exon.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) are the most common known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND). We assessed whether expansion size is associated with disease severity or phenotype.
METHODS: We did a cross-sectional Southern blot characterisation study (Xpansize-72) in a cohort of individuals with FTD, MND, both these diseases, or no clinical phenotype. All participants had GGGGCC repeat expansions in C9ORF72, and high quality DNA was available from one or more of the frontal cortex, cerebellum, or blood. We used Southern blotting techniques and densitometry to estimate the repeat size of the most abundant expansion species. We compared repeat sizes between different tissues using Wilcoxon rank sum and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and between disease subgroups using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. We assessed the association of repeat size with age at onset and age at collection using a Spearman's test of correlation, and assessed the association between repeat size and survival after disease onset using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
FINDINGS: We included 84 individuals with C9ORF72 expansions: 35 had FTD, 16 had FTD and MND, 30 had MND, and three had no clinical phenotype. We focused our analysis on three major tissue subgroups: frontal cortex (available from 41 patients [21 with FTD, 11 with FTD and MND, and nine with MND]), cerebellum (40 patients [20 with FTD, 12 with FTD and MND, and eight with MND]), and blood (47 patients [15 with FTD, nine with FTD and MND, and 23 with MND] and three carriers who had no clinical phenotype). Repeat lengths in the cerebellum were smaller (median 12·3 kb [about 1667 repeat units], IQR 11·1-14·3) than those in the frontal cortex (33·8 kb [about 5250 repeat units], 23·5-44·9; p{\textless}0·0001) and those in blood (18·6 kb [about 2717 repeat units], 13·9-28·1; p=0·0002). Within these tissues, we detected no difference in repeat length between disease subgroups (cerebellum p=0·96, frontal cortex p=0·27, blood p=0·10). In the frontal cortex of patients with FTD, repeat length correlated with age at onset (r=0·63; p=0·003) and age at sample collection (r=0·58; p=0·006); we did not detect such a correlation in samples from the cerebellum or blood. When assessing cerebellum samples from the overall cohort, survival after disease onset was 4·8 years (IQR 3·0-7·4) in the group with expansions greater than 1467 repeat units (the 25th percentile of repeat lengths) versus 7·4 years (6·3-10·9) in the group with smaller expansions (HR 3·27, 95\% CI 1·34-7·95; p=0·009).
INTERPRETATION: We detected substantial variation in repeat sizes between samples from the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and blood, and longer repeat sizes in the cerebellum seem to be associated with a survival disadvantage. Our findings indicate that expansion size does affect disease severity, which--if replicated in other cohorts--could be relevant for genetic counselling.

We tested the hypothesis that the repeat expansion causes aberrant CpG methylation near the G4C2 repeat, which could be responsible for the downregulation of gene expression. We investigated the CpG methylation profile by two methods using genomic DNA from the blood of individuals with ALS (37 expansion carriers and 64 noncarriers), normal controls (n = 76), and family members of 7 ALS probands with the expansion. We report that hypermethylation of the CpG island 5' of the G4C2 repeat is associated with the presence of the expansion (p {\textless} 0.0001). A higher degree of methylation was significantly correlated with a shorter disease duration (p {\textless} 0.01), associated with familial ALS (p = 0.009) and segregated with the expansion in 7 investigated families. Notably, we did not detect methylation for either normal or intermediate alleles (up to 43 repeats), bringing to question the current cutoff of 30 repeats for pathological alleles. Our study raises several important questions for the future investigation of large data sets, such as whether the degree of methylation corresponds to clinical presentation (ALS versus FTLD).},

  abstract = {C9orf72 promoter hypermethylation inhibits the accumulation of pathologies which have been postulated to be neurotoxic. We tested here whether C9orf72 hypermethylation is associated with prolonged disease in C9orf72 mutation carriers. C9orf72 methylation was quantified from brain or blood using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digest-qPCR in a cross-sectional cohort of 118 C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers and 19 non-carrier family members. Multivariate regression models were used to determine whether C9orf72 hypermethylation was associated with age at onset, disease duration, age at death, or hexanucleotide repeat expansion size. Permutation analysis was performed to determine whether C9orf72 methylation is heritable. We observed a high correlation between C9orf72 methylation across tissues including cerebellum, frontal cortex, spinal cord and peripheral blood. While C9orf72 methylation was not significantly different between ALS and FTD and did not predict age at onset, brain and blood C9orf72 hypermethylation was associated with later age at death in FTD (brain: β = 0.18, p = 0.006; blood: β = 0.15, p {\textless} 0.001), and blood C9orf72 hypermethylation was associated with longer disease duration in FTD (β = 0.03, p = 0.007). Furthermore, C9orf72 hypermethylation was associated with smaller hexanucleotide repeat length (β = -16.69, p = 0.033). Finally, analysis of pedigrees with multiple mutation carriers demonstrated a significant association between C9orf72 methylation and family relatedness (p {\textless} 0.0001). C9orf72 hypermethylation is associated with prolonged disease in C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers with FTD. The attenuated clinical phenotype associated with C9orf72 hypermethylation suggests that slower clinical progression in FTD is associated with reduced expression of mutant C9orf72. These results support the hypothesis that expression of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion is associated with a toxic gain of function.},

We developed a protocol to generate ultra-long reads (N50 {\textgreater} 100 kb, read lengths up to 882 kb). Incorporating an additional 5× coverage of these ultra-long reads more than doubled the assembly contiguity (NG50 ∼6.4 Mb). The final assembled genome was 2,867 million bases in size, covering 85.8\% of the reference. Assembly accuracy, after incorporating complementary short-read sequencing data, exceeded 99.8\%. Ultra-long reads enabled assembly and phasing of the 4-Mb major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus in its entirety, measurement of telomere repeat length, and closure of gaps in the reference human genome assembly GRCh38.},

A fundamental question is whether toxicity is driven by the repeat RNA itself and/or by dipeptide repeat proteins generated by repeat-associated, non-ATG translation. To address this question, we developed in vitro and in vivo models to dissect repeat RNA and dipeptide repeat protein toxicity. Expression of pure repeats, but not stop codon-interrupted "RNA-only" repeats in Drosophila caused adult-onset neurodegeneration. Thus, expanded repeats promoted neurodegeneration through dipeptide repeat proteins. Expression of individual dipeptide repeat proteins with a non-GGGGCC RNA sequence revealed that both poly-(glycine-arginine) and poly-(proline-arginine) proteins caused neurodegeneration. These findings are consistent with a dual toxicity mechanism, whereby both arginine-rich proteins and repeat RNA contribute to C9orf72-mediated neurodegeneration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Basecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here, we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish.
RESULTS: Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ('polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.},

Typically this involves alignment of new data to a reference, where both reference construction and alignment have been performed by hand.
RESULTS: We propose an automated method for aligning nanopore data to a reference through the use of hidden Markov models. Several features that arise from prior processing steps and from the class of enzyme used can be simply incorporated into the model. Previously, the M2MspA nanopore was shown to be sensitive enough to distinguish between cytosine, methylcytosine and hydroxymethylcytosine. We validated our automated methodology on a subset of that data by automatically calculating an error rate for the distinction between the three cytosine variants and show that the automated methodology produces a 2-3\% error rate, lower than the 10\% error rate from previous manual segmentation and alignment.

Here we report transgenic mice carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the full human C9orf72 gene with either a normal allele (15 repeats) or disease-associated expansion (∼100-1,000 repeats; C9-BACexp). C9-BACexp mice displayed pathologic features seen in C9orf72 expansion patients, including widespread RNA foci and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translated dipeptides, which were suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides targeting human C9orf72. Nucleolin distribution was altered, supporting that either C9orf72 transcripts or RAN dipeptides promote nucleolar dysfunction. Despite early and widespread production of RNA foci and RAN dipeptides in C9-BACexp mice, behavioral abnormalities and neurodegeneration were not observed even at advanced ages, supporting the hypothesis that RNA foci and RAN dipeptides occur presymptomatically and are not sufficient to drive neurodegeneration in mice at levels seen in patients.},

Here, we report characterization of Cpf1, a putative class 2 CRISPR effector. We demonstrate that Cpf1 mediates robust DNA interference with features distinct from Cas9. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, and it utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif. Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. Out of 16 Cpf1-family proteins, we identified two candidate enzymes from Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae, with efficient genome-editing activity in human cells. Identifying this mechanism of interference broadens our understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and advances their genome editing applications.},

  abstract = {New research suggests that common pathways are altered in many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder; however, little is known about early molecular events that contribute to the pathology of these diseases. The study of monogenic, neurodevelopmental disorders with a high incidence of autistic behaviours, such as fragile X syndrome, has the potential to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in autism spectrum disorder as well as fragile X syndrome. In vitro generation of human disease-relevant cell types provides the ability to investigate aspects of disease that are impossible to study in patients or animal models. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells recapitulates development of the neocortex, an area affected in both fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. We have generated induced human pluripotent stem cells from several individuals clinically diagnosed with fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. When differentiated to dorsal forebrain cell fates, our fragile X syndrome human pluripotent stem cell lines exhibited reproducible aberrant neurogenic phenotypes. Using global gene expression and DNA methylation profiling, we have analysed the early stages of neurogenesis in fragile X syndrome human pluripotent stem cells. We discovered aberrant DNA methylation patterns at specific genomic regions in fragile X syndrome cells, and identified dysregulated gene- and network-level correlates of fragile X syndrome that are associated with developmental signalling, cell migration, and neuronal maturation. Integration of our gene expression and epigenetic analysis identified altered epigenetic-mediated transcriptional regulation of a distinct set of genes in fragile X syndrome. These fragile X syndrome-aberrant networks are significantly enriched for genes associated with autism spectrum disorder, giving support to the idea that underlying similarities exist among these neurodevelopmental diseases.},

We used in vitro selection and high-throughput sequencing to determine the propensity of eight guide-RNA:Cas9 complexes to cleave each of 10(12) potential off-target DNA sequences. The selection results predicted five off-target sites in the human genome that were confirmed to undergo genome cleavage in HEK293T cells upon expression of one of two guide-RNA:Cas9 complexes. In contrast to previous models, our results show that guide-RNA:Cas9 specificity extends past a 7- to 12-base-pair seed sequence. Our results also suggest a tradeoff between activity and specificity both in vitro and in cells as a shorter, less-active guide RNA is more specific than a longer, more-active guide RNA. High concentrations of guide-RNA:Cas9 complexes can cleave off-target sites containing mutations near or within the PAM that are not cleaved when enzyme concentrations are limiting.},

  abstract = {Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation in man. The disease is associated with expansion in the number of tandem CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the human FMR1 gene. Transmitting males, individuals who are unaffected carriers of the disease, show a moderate increase in the number of repeat units, while fully penetrant males show a major expansion in repeat number. Major expansion of the repeat in affected males is correlated with methylation of certain restriction enzyme recognition sites in the 5' CpG island containing the trinucleotide repeat in these patients. Phenotypic expression of the mutation appears to be due to transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene. We now report direct high resolution methylation analysis of the trinucleotide repeat and its flanking regions using ligation-mediated PCR genomic sequencing. We find the cytosine residue of all CpG dinucleotides examined within and surrounding the FMR1 trinucleotide repeat to be unmethylated in the DNA of normal male leukocytes and transmitting male lymphoblasts; these same cytosines are methylated in affected male lymphoblasts, in a somatic cell hybrid containing a fragile X chromosome from an affected male, and in a somatic cell hybrid containing a normal inactive X chromosome. The methylation pattern of the FMR1 5' CpG island in affected patients as determined by genomic sequencing is remarkably similar to that seen for the X-linked human phosphoglycerate kinase and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene 5' CpG islands on the inactive human X chromosome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The most common cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a G4C2-repeat expansion in C9orf72. However, the lower limit for pathological repeats has not been established and expansions with different sizes could have different pathological consequences. One of the implicated disease mechanisms is haploinsufficiency. Previously, we identified expansion-specific hypermethylation at the 5' CpG-island near the G4C2-repeat, but only in a fraction of carriers (up to 36 \%). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the G4C2-repeat itself could be the main site of methylation. To evaluate (G4C2)n -methylation, we developed a novel assay, which was validated by an independent methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme assay. Notably, both assays are qualitative but not quantitative. Blood DNA was available for 270 unrelated individuals, including 71 expansion carriers. In addition, we investigated blood DNA from family members of 16 probands, and 38 DNA samples from multiple tissues of 10 expansion carriers. Finally, we tested DNA from different tissues of an ALS patient carrying a somatically unstable 90-repeat. We demonstrated that the G4C2-expansion is generally methylated in unrelated carriers of alleles {\textgreater}50 repeats (97 \%), while small ({\textless}22 repeats) or intermediate (22-90 repeats) alleles were completely unmethylated. The presence of (G4C2)n -methylation does not separate the C9orf72-phenotypes (ALS vs. ALS/FTLD vs. FTLD), but has the potential to predict large vs. intermediate repeat length. Our results suggest that (G4C2)n -methylation might sometimes spread to the 5'-upstream region, but not vice versa. It is stable over time, since (G4C2)n -methylation was detected in carriers with a wide range of ages (24-74 years). It was identified in both blood and brain tissues for the same individual, implying its potential use as a biomarker. Furthermore, our findings may open up new perspectives for studying disease mechanisms, such as determining whether methylated and unmethylated repeats have the same ability to form a G-quadruplex configuration.},

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics has recommended diagnostic testing for fragile X in symptomatic persons, women with ovarian dysfunction, and persons with tremor/ataxia syndrome. Although medical and scientific professionals do not currently recommend screening nonsymptomatic populations, improvements in current treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials have generated growing interest in screening for fragile X. Here, we briefly review the relevant molecular basis of fragile X and fragile X testing and compare three different molecular technologies available for fragile X screening in both males and females. These technologic approaches include destabilizing the CGG-repeat region with betaine and using chimeric CGG-targeted PCR primers, using heat pulses to destabilize C-G bonds in the PCR extension step, and using melting curve analysis to differentiate expanded CGG repeats from normals. The first two-step method performed with high sensitivity and specificity. The second method provided agarose gel images that allow identification of males with expanded CGG repeats and females with expanded CGG-repeat bands which are sometimes faint. The third melting curve analysis method would require controls in each run to correct for shifting optimal cutoff values.},

The repeat region is within sequences characteristic of a CpG island. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides that are 5' to the CGG repeat has been shown to occur on the inactive X chromosome of normal females and on the X chromosome of affected fragile-X males, and is correlated with silencing of the FMR1 gene. The methylation status of CpG sites 3' to the repeat and within the repeat itself has not previously been reported. We have used two methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, AciI and Fnu4HI, to further characterize the methylation pattern of the FMR1 CpG island in normal individuals and in those carrying fragile-X mutations. Our results indicate that: (i) CpG dinucleotides on the 3' side of the CGG repeat are part of the CpG island that is methylated during inactivation of a normal X chromosome in females; (ii) the CGG repeats are also part of the CpG island and are extensively methylated as a result of normal X-chromosome inactivation; (iii) similar to normal males, unaffected fragile-X males with small CGG expansions are unmethylated in the CpG island; for affected males, the patterns of methylation are similar to those of a normal, inactive X chromosome; (iv) in contrast to the partial methylation observed for certain sites in lymphocyte DNA, complete methylation was observed in DNA from cell lines containing either a normal inactive X chromosome or a fragile-X chromosome from an affected male.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Third-generation sequencing platforms such as single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and nanopore sequencing provide longer reads and are able to characterize variations that are undetected in NGS data. Nevertheless, these technologies suffer from inherent low throughput which prohibits deep sequencing at reasonable cost without target enrichment. Here, we optimized Cas9-Assisted Targeting of CHromosome segments (CATCH) for nanopore sequencing of the breast cancer gene BRCA1. A 200 kb target containing the 80 kb BRCA1 gene body and its flanking regions was isolated intact from primary human peripheral blood cells, allowing long-range amplification and long-read nanopore sequencing. The target was enriched 237-fold and sequenced at up to 70× coverage on a single flow-cell. Overall performance and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling were directly compared to Illumina sequencing of the same enriched sample, highlighting the benefits of CATCH for targeted sequencing. The CATCH enrichment scheme only requires knowledge of the target flanking sequence for Cas9 cleavage while providing contiguous data across both coding and non-coding sequence and holds promise for characterization of complex disease-related or highly variable genomic regions.},

For example the sequencing of the human genome (Venter et al., 2001) would not have been possible without advanced assembly algorithms and the development of practical BWT based read mappers have been instrumental for NGS analysis. However, owing to the high speed of technological progress and the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there was a widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread use. We previously addressed this by introducing the SeqAn library of efficient data types and algorithms in 2008 (Döring et al., 2008).
RESULTS: The SeqAn library has matured considerably since its first publication 9 years ago. In this article we review its status as an established resource for programmers in the field of sequence analysis and its contributions to many analysis tools.
CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that SeqAn will continue to be a valuable resource, especially since it started to actively support various hardware acceleration techniques in a systematic manner.},

With the ability to generate reads tens to thousands of kilobases in length with an accuracy approaching that of short-read sequencing technologies, these platforms have proven their ability to resolve some of the most challenging regions of the human genome, detect previously inaccessible structural variants and generate some of the first telomere-to-telomere assemblies of whole chromosomes. Long-read sequencing technologies will soon permit the routine assembly of diploid genomes, which will revolutionize genomics by revealing the full spectrum of human genetic variation, resolving some of the missing heritability and leading to the discovery of novel mechanisms of disease.},

Although long single molecule sequencing reads are better able to resolve genomic repeats than short-read data, most long-read assembly algorithms do not provide the repeat characterization necessary for producing optimal assemblies. Here, we present Flye, a long-read assembly algorithm that generates arbitrary paths in an unknown repeat graph, called disjointigs, and constructs an accurate repeat graph from these error-riddled disjointigs. We benchmark Flye against five state-of-the-art assemblers and show that it generates better or comparable assemblies, while being an order of magnitude faster. Flye nearly doubled the contiguity of the human genome assembly (as measured by the NGA50 assembly quality metric) compared with existing assemblers.},

However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of {\textgreater}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

  abstract  = {Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of T’s. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 T’s, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 T’s and therefore concerns more than 20\% of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene.},

  abstract   = {Repetitive DNA, formerly referred to by the misnomer “junk DNA,” comprises a majority of the human genome. One class of this DNA, alpha satellite, comprises up to 10\% of the genome. Alpha satellite is enriched at all human centromere regions and is competent for de novo centromere assembly. Because of the highly repetitive nature of alpha satellite, it has been difficult to achieve genome assemblies at centromeres using traditional next-generation sequencing approaches, and thus, centromeres represent gaps in the current human genome assembly. Moreover, alpha satellite DNA is transcribed into repetitive noncoding RNA and contributes to a large portion of the transcriptome. Recent efforts to characterize these transcripts and their function have uncovered pivotal roles for satellite RNA in genome stability, including silencing “selfish” DNA elements and recruiting centromere and kinetochore proteins. This review will describe the genomic and epigenetic features of alpha satellite DNA, discuss recent findings of noncoding transcripts produced from distinct alpha satellite arrays, and address current progress in the functional understanding of this oft-neglected repetitive sequence. We will discuss unique challenges of studying human satellite DNAs and RNAs and point toward new technologies that will continue to advance our understanding of this largely untapped portion of the genome.},

  abstract  = {Nanopore DNA sequencing enables the sequence determination of single DNA molecules up to 10,000 times longer than currently permitted by second-generation sequencing platforms. Nanopore sequencing gives real-time access to sequencing data and enables the detection of epigenetic modifications. This unique feature set is poised to foster the development of novel biomedical applications previously deemed unfeasible. Nanopore sequencing is based on picoampere scale measurement of current modulated by DNA or RNA polymers traveling through a nanometer opening between two compartments. Each of the five canonical nucleobases (A, T, G, C, U) has a characteristic electrical resistance, which ultimately enables the determination of the precise base sequence. However, a substantial computational effort is required to resolve the underlying sequence from a time-warped and noisy stream of digitized current measurements. Recently, a wide range of digital signal analysis and machine learning methods have been developed for Nanopore sequencing applications. Clinically relevant questions, such as the quantification of short repetitive DNA sequences remain an unresolved challenge to current generic, state-of-the-art nanopore data analysis methods. We believe realistic simulation of the signal stream can be instrumental in the development of tailored algorithms for such novel biomedical applications. Based on our work with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION and PromethION platform, we have developed Nanopore SimulatION, a software package for the in silico generation of realistic, raw-signal-level data. Nanopore SimulatION starts from a reference genome in conjunction with a configuration and model file derived from real-world nanopore sequencing experiments as input. To validate our algorithm, we have sequenced custom synthetic DNA, and in so doing have generated a “ground-truth” data set potentially useful for downstream algorithm development. Additionally, we demonstrate Nanopore SimulatION` s utility for method development in typical clinical use cases.

  abstract  = {The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real valued.Many researchers have also considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these symbolic approaches require one to have access to all the data, before creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts efforts to use the representations with streaming algorithms.In this work we introduce a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only an infinitesimal time and space overhead.We will demonstrate the utility of our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content and anomaly detection.},

  abstract  = {DNA methylation is of paramount importance for mammalian embryonic development. DNA methylation has numerous functions: it is implicated in the repression of transposons and genes, but is also associated with actively transcribed gene bodies and, in some cases, with gene activation per se. In recent years, sensitive technologies have been developed that allow the interrogation of DNA methylation patterns from a small number of cells. The use of these technologies has greatly improved our knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics and heterogeneity in embryos and in specific tissues. Combined with genetic analyses, it is increasingly apparent that regulation of DNA methylation erasure and (re-)establishment varies considerably between different developmental stages. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and functions of DNA methylation and demethylation in both mice and humans at CpG-rich promoters, gene bodies and transposable elements. We highlight the dynamic erasure and re-establishment of DNA methylation in embryonic, germline and somatic cell development. Finally, we provide insights into DNA methylation gained from studying genetic diseases.},

  abstract  = {Physical access to DNA is a highly dynamic property of chromatin that plays an essential role in establishing and maintaining cellular identity. The organization of accessible chromatin across the genome reflects a network of permissible physical interactions through which enhancers, promoters, insulators and chromatin-binding factors cooperatively regulate gene expression. This landscape of accessibility changes dynamically in response to both external stimuli and developmental cues, and emerging evidence suggests that homeostatic maintenance of accessibility is itself dynamically regulated through a competitive interplay between chromatin-binding factors and nucleosomes. In this Review, we examine how the accessible genome is measured and explore the role of transcription factors in initiating accessibility remodelling; our goal is to illustrate how chromatin accessibility defines regulatory elements within the genome and how these epigenetic features are dynamically established to control gene expression.},
